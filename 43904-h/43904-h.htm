<br />THE MYSTERIOUS CHINAMAN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, my young friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson started at the
sound of these words spoken by someone close
behind him. He had been seated in a corner
of the park. It was early evening, but quite
dark. He sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon! Please do not go away.&rdquo; There
was something reassuring in the slow easy
drawl of the stranger. Johnny dropped back
to his place. Next instant as the light of a
passing car played upon the stranger, he was
tempted to laugh. He found himself looking
into the face of the smallest Chinaman he had
ever known. To Johnny the expression &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
afraid of a Chinaman?&rdquo; was better known than
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s afraid of the big bad wolf?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>But what did this little man with his very
much wrinkled face puckered into a strange
smile, want? Johnny leaned forward expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think hard. You are worried. Is it
not so?&rdquo; The little man took a seat beside him.
&ldquo;All the time you think baseball. You do not
play. But you think very much. Is it not so?
This town, your team, they are everything just
now. Is it not so? And you are troubled.&rdquo; The
wrinkles on the little yellow man&rsquo;s face appeared
to crinkle and crackle like very old
parchment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you,&rdquo; he put a hand on Johnny&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;You think of Centralia. A long
time you have thought, &lsquo;They will defeat us
unless we find a pitcher, a very good pitcher.&rsquo;
And you have found a pitcher. Perhaps he will
do. You are not sure. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started. All this was true. Centralia
was the great rival of the little city he chanced
to call home at that moment. He was thinking
of the coming game. But this new pitcher!
That was a closely guarded secret. Only three
people knew and they were pledged to silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the little man leaned forward, &ldquo;You
are more greatly troubled now. You are thinking,
&lsquo;Someone has told.&rsquo; No, my young friend,
it has not been told. It is given Tao Sing to
know many things. Tao Sing can tell you
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Tao Sing?&rdquo; Johnny fixed his eyes
on the dark face beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Tao Sing.&rdquo; The little man blinked
strangely. &ldquo;It is written, I shall be your friend.
Tao Sing shall tell you many things. Ah yes,
many, many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was astonished, so much so that for
an instant his eyes strayed away to the deep
shadows beyond. When his gaze returned the
dark figure of the little yellow man was gone.
He had vanished into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he know that?&rdquo; the boy asked
himself in great perplexity. &ldquo;I have only
known it three days. It has been a pledged
secret.&rdquo; Here indeed was a mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Johnny Thompson was, at that moment, living
in the little city of Hillcrest. Having wandered
the world over, sleeping beneath the
tropical moon and the Midnight Sun, and
meeting with all manner of weird adventures,
he had returned to the place that had fascinated
him most as a very small boy&mdash;his grandfather&rsquo;s
home. At the edge of this sleepy little
city, a hundred and fifty miles from any truly
great city, Johnny had found the rambling old
home still standing, and in it, a little grayer
and slower, but still his kindly old self, was
his grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come for a long stay this time,
Johnny,&rdquo; he said with a warming smile.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny had replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of big
cities, of adventures and mysteries. I&mdash;well,
I guess I&rsquo;d just like to sit in the sun awhile
and&mdash;well, perhaps play around a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fine ball team,&rdquo; the old man had
said enthusiastically. &ldquo;Lots of interest in it
this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baseball&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny said the word slowly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather poor at that. Might be ways I
could help though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there had been ways. When their best
pitcher&rsquo;s arm went bad and their hopes of winning
the Summer League pennant promised
to go aglimmering, he had marched bravely
into the office of Colonel Chamberlain, the
town&rsquo;s most resourceful business man, and
said, &ldquo;Colonel, it&rsquo;s up to you to help us out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>To Johnny&rsquo;s vast surprise the Colonel replied,
&ldquo;Sure I will, Johnny.&rdquo; At the same time
the Colonel had smiled a mysterious smile.
&ldquo;Truth is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sort of holding
out on you boys. I&rsquo;ve got a man right here in
the laboratories who can throw circles all
around any pitcher in the League.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here in the lab&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see!&rdquo; the Colonel stopped Johnny.
&ldquo;You bring Doug Danby around tomorrow
night.&rdquo; (Doug was Captain of the team.)
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have him throw over a few for you, just in
private.&rdquo; He had kept his promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mysteries,&rdquo; Johnny thought, sitting there
in the park in the dark after the little Chinaman
had vanished. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not just in big
cities nor in tropical jungles either. You find
them everywhere. Take that pitcher&mdash;one of
the most mysterious persons I ever saw. Such
a strange looking chap too&mdash;dark-skinned as
some priest from India. And can he pitch!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, oh boy!&rdquo; He spoke aloud without
meaning to. &ldquo;Will we win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my friend!&rdquo; So startled this time was
Johnny, at once more hearing the sound of the
little yellow man&rsquo;s voice that he sprang to his
feet, wild-eyed and staring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, my friend, you will not win,&rdquo; the little
man repeated quietly. &ldquo;There is a reason.
Soon I shall tell you the reason, my young
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny saw a yellow hand waving before
him for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more thing I will tell you,&rdquo; the little
man continued. &ldquo;There is a pep meeting tomorrow
night. You will not go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not finish. Once more the little
yellow man had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you know that?&rdquo; Johnny called
into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a picture of your thoughts,&rdquo; came
drifting back. &ldquo;You will not believe. Sometime
I shall show you this picture of your
thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a picture of my thoughts.&rdquo; Johnny
dropped back to his place on the bench. &ldquo;A
picture of my thoughts? How could that be?
And yet&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could he know?&rdquo; he repeated after a
long period of silence. And indeed how could
this little man know all he had told? In regard
to the mysterious pitcher the Colonel had discovered
for the team, there was a bare chance
that someone had talked. They, the three of
them, Doug Danby, Colonel Chamberlain, and
Johnny, had agreed to keep this a secret for
at least one more day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he thought slowly, &ldquo;someone might
have talked. But that pep meeting! I only decided
last night that I&rsquo;d better not go. And
yet he, a strange Chinaman I have never seen
before, he comes and tells me what I have
thought. How strange! How&mdash;how sort of
impossible. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he had a picture of my thoughts.
I&mdash;I hope he brings it round for me to see.&rdquo;
Laughing a short uncertain laugh, the boy
rose from the bench to walk slowly toward his
grandfather&rsquo;s home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>A rather strange city was this one where,
for the time, Johnny had a home. No city of
its size has a more unusual population. A
dozen or more years back it had been a mere
village. Only native-born Americans lived
there. Then it began to grow. The Chinese
people came first. For some reason all his own,
a very rich Chinese merchant, Wung Lu, had
settled there. In almost no time at all, he had
gathered about him a large group of the
strange little yellow men. They had erected a
Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Men came
from afar to bargain here for Oriental goods
from across the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re queer, these little yellow men,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself now, &ldquo;but somehow I like
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, though he was not very conscious of it,
this was one of Johnny&rsquo;s great gifts. He had
a way of &ldquo;somehow liking&rdquo; everyone. And because
they somehow came to know this, they
liked him in turn. He and Wung Lu, the
Chinese merchant who, rumor had it, was immensely
rich, had become great friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this little fellow with the wrinkled
face,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;now who can he be? I supposed
I had seen them all. And he is one I
could never forget, yet I&rsquo;ve never seen him
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange sort of fellow,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Said
he had a picture of my thoughts. How could
he have? But then how could he know those
things he told me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Johnny had read books about the way people
think. He remembered reading something
about one person being able to read another&rsquo;s
thoughts. Could this little man do that? Had
he read his thoughts? He shuddered a little.
It was so mysterious, so sort of ghost-like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have read my mind, at least
not when he found out I wasn&rsquo;t going to the
pep meeting. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it once, at
least not tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole affair was so baffling that he
gave it up and turned his thoughts to Saturday&rsquo;s
baseball game.</p>
<p>Johnny had known for a long time that Centralia,
nine miles away, and Hillcrest had been
rivals, friendly rivals, but the keenest of rivals
all the same. For four years, one straight after
the other, Centralia had won the annual summer
baseball tournament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year,&rdquo; Johnny thought, &ldquo;Hillcrest almost
beat them in the last game. But this year
we&rsquo;ll win if&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then&mdash;&rdquo; his mood changed. &ldquo;He said
we wouldn&rsquo;t win, that little yellow man with
the wrinkled face said that!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
half in anger. &ldquo;How could he know? And yet,
how could he know what I had been thinking?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well!&rdquo; He stamped the ground defiantly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s one game? There are others to
be played. If we lose one, we&rsquo;ll win in the end.
And we&rsquo;ll not lose this one! See if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. Soft footsteps were approaching.
It was the little Chinaman again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s he,&rdquo; Johnny whispered. &ldquo;Will I never
get rid of him? He&rsquo;s like a shadow, a ghost
haunting a fellow in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the little man came close to Johnny he
said in a voice that was little more than a whisper,
&ldquo;You know that Centralia baseball captain,
Barney Bradford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny grumbled, &ldquo;Of course I do. Suppose
you have a picture of his thoughts too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-s-s,&rdquo; the little man drawled, &ldquo;Tao Sing
has picture of that one&rsquo;s thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have?&rdquo; This affair was getting almost
funny. &ldquo;What does he think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks his pitcher has been sick. He
thinks, not sick now. Pitch tomorrow. Win
tomorrow. He thinks this&mdash;Barney Bradford.&rdquo;
The little Chinaman let out a low cackle. &ldquo;I
have the picture of his thoughts. So now you
know that Tao Sing tell no lie. You did not
know this pitcher is well again. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I did not know,&rdquo; Johnny agreed reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your team mates did not know. But
Tao Sing, he know. Listen!&rdquo; The little man&rsquo;s
voice dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;You are a friend
of Wung Lu, the rich and wise one, is it not
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Johnny stammered,
too astonished to think clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, you are a friend of Wung Lu,&rdquo; the
little man murmured. &ldquo;Perhaps some day I
will show you the picture of your thoughts.
Perhaps very soon, some day I shall show
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the little yellow man vanished
into the darkness. He left an astonished boy
staring at the place where he had been.</p>
<p>A few moments later Johnny met Meggy
Strawn at his own door. Meggy was champion
cheer leader for Hillcrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Johnny, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Why all the gloom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burt Standish is going to pitch tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burt! He can&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s got heart trouble.
Johnny, who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny stopped short. He
couldn&rsquo;t tell Meggy that some little Chinaman
had taken a picture of Barney Bradford&rsquo;s
thoughts. That would sound sort of queer.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;I just found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I believe it,&rdquo; he thought to himself
as he hurried past her.</p>
<p>There was reason enough to believe, for
next day as Johnny took his place on the
bleachers there was Burt Standish, the pitcher
who was supposed to have serious heart trouble,
on the mound warming up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew,&rdquo; Johnny told himself with sudden
shock. &ldquo;That little Chinaman knew! And
yet Centralia succeeded in keeping it a dead
secret. Not a player on our team knew Burt
was to pitch.&rdquo; His respect for the little Chinaman&rsquo;s
mind reading, or whatever it might be,
rose several notches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />A STRANGE PROPHECY COMES TRUE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; someone exclaimed. &ldquo;There is
Burt Standish! He&rsquo;s going to pitch
against us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny knew that voice. It was Meggy
Strawn. Johnny could not quite remember
when he first played with Meggy. Many summers
he had visited at Grandfather Thompson&rsquo;s
old-fashioned house, and Meg was always
there. She lived only three doors away.
He remembered her in rompers, short dresses
and knickers. Now she was sixteen. Her
bright orange sweater and skirt of brilliant
blue somehow matched her sharply turned-up
nose and freckled cheeks. Meg was real. Johnny
thought her the realest girl he had ever
known. &ldquo;Not soft,&rdquo; was the way he had expressed
it, &ldquo;Just gloriously old-fashioned, no
painted lips, nor cheeks either, and no cigarets&mdash;nothing
like that; just all girl! And pep!
Say, there&rsquo;s not a girl with half her get-up-and-go,
not in the whole big city of Chicago,
or anywhere else!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Yes, Johnny liked Meg. And now as he
smiled at her he said, &ldquo;Burt Standish will
pitch, and we&rsquo;ll lose the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose! Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; Meg grabbed his arm.
&ldquo;Why do you say that? I just heard we were
to have a marvelous pitcher, a real star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed slowly. &ldquo;Guess I
know as much about that as&mdash;well, as anyone,
except Colonel Chamberlain. All the same,
we&rsquo;ll lose. You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crepe hanger!&rdquo; Meg gave him a shake.
&ldquo;Just you watch our smoke!&rdquo; Seizing a megaphone,
she sprang out upon the turf to shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea! Yea! Yea! Team! Team! Team!&rdquo;
Then, as her lithe young body swayed in
rhythmic motion there came back from a hundred
throats:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea! Yea! Yea! Team! Team! Team!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same, as Meg dropped to a place beside
him on the grass, Johnny repeated solemnly,
&ldquo;We lose. Tao Sing knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Meggy gave him a sharp look.
&ldquo;Who is Tao Sing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Johnny did not reply.</p>
<p>A moment later, at a motion from Colonel
Chamberlain, who had just come onto the field,
Johnny walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Johnny.&rdquo; The Colonel&rsquo;s face
was sober as Johnny reached his side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
tough break for the team, but J. can&rsquo;t be with
us today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jay?&rdquo; Johnny stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you are thinking J-a-y.&rdquo; The
Colonel smiled. &ldquo;Just leave the last two letters
off. That&rsquo;s what our star pitcher prefers
to be known by&mdash;just the plain letter &lsquo;J.&rsquo; And,
as I was saying, I couldn&rsquo;t get him out&mdash;not
today. He&mdash;he told me he didn&rsquo;t want to
chance it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chance what?&rdquo; Johnny was keenly disappointed.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid his arm wouldn&rsquo;t hold out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that. Something else. I can&rsquo;t explain
further.&rdquo; The Colonel&rsquo;s voice dropped. &ldquo;Just
tell the boys we&rsquo;re sorry. Hope he can be with
you next game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>It was a very sober Johnny who walked
toward the spot where the Hillcrest team was
gathered, waiting, expectant, hoping at any
moment to see their new pitcher. This quiet,
old-fashioned city had somehow gotten into
Johnny&rsquo;s blood. It was the home of his ancestors.
He loved it for that and for other reasons.
The people who lived here stood for
certain things&mdash;that is, most of them did.
They were honest, or at least as honest as
they knew how to be. They were kind to the
unfortunate. They believed in both work and
rest. Saturday afternoon was their time for
recreation. They loved their ball games. And
there were very special reasons why, this year,
these games <i>must</i> be a grand success. Johnny
knew this. That was one reason for his sober
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; he said quietly, a moment later, to
Doug Danby, the captain. &ldquo;The Colonel just
told me our surprise pitcher won&rsquo;t be here today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be here?&rdquo; Doug&rsquo;s jaw dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well!&rdquo; he sighed a moment later. &ldquo;Just
have to make the best of it. And&mdash;&rdquo; his lips
closed tight. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; These words were on
Johnny&rsquo;s lips. They remained unsaid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Johnny grinned at Meg as he returned
to his place. &ldquo;Our star pitcher will
not be here! What does that mean? What
did I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you and your mysterious Chinaman!&rdquo;
Meg scoffed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win, you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not truly hear this outburst. He
was wondering, in a strange and sudden sort
of way, whether there could be any connection
between the mysterious little Chinaman
and the failure of their star pitcher to appear.
&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he whispered to himself. All
the same, he did not feel quite sure.</p>
<p>If they lost that game it would not be Meggy&rsquo;s
fault. This became evident from the
start. With her bright sweater thrown carelessly
upon the ground, shapely brown arms
waving, nimble feet dancing, she led the cheering
as no cheer leader had done before.</p>
<p>And it did seem from the start that old
Hillcrest had more than an even chance. Fred
Frame, their regular pitcher, whose arm had a
mean way of going back on him just at the
wrong moment, held his place in the box and
pitched remarkably well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Hillcrest went into the lead in the first inning.
They held that lead doggedly until the
fifth. In the sixth they slipped. Three runs
came in for the rival team, and Hillcrest stood
one score behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be too bad if we lose,&rdquo; Johnny
said soberly as Meg, seizing his arm to steady
herself for a moment, whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;Every
game counts. The fans want victory.
They want the pennant, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish for at that moment Doug
Danby, captain of the Hillcrest team, got a
homer, tying the score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ray! Ray! Ray! Doug! Doug! Doug!&rdquo;
Meggy was away like a flaming rocket.</p>
<p>The first half of the eighth found Hillcrest
ahead by two runs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, we&rsquo;re going to win!&rdquo; Meggy was
jumping up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Johnny soberly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to
lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, why do you say that? We&rsquo;re two
runs ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s face was solemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why <i>did</i> I say that?&rdquo; he thought to
himself a moment later. &ldquo;Just because that
little Chinaman said it. And how could he
know?&rdquo; He was quite disgusted with himself.
And yet&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show them!&rdquo; Meggy cried. Seizing
a megaphone, once again she sprang to the
grass before the grandstand.</p>
<p>Johnny cheered loudest of all and hoped
with all his heart that his dire prophecy might
not come true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo; Meggy screamed. &ldquo;Of course
we will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hillcrest came up to bat. The dark eyes of
the opposing pitcher gleamed as he sent the
ball streaking across the plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike three!&rdquo; The umpire&rsquo;s voice boomed,
and Hillcrest&rsquo;s star batter went down. Two
others followed in a row.</p>
<p>A hush fell over the grandstand as the home
players took their places on the diamond. It
was now or never.</p>
<p>The pitcher seemed nervous. The balls went
wild. The short, stocky catcher waited the
next in grim silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Johnny was hopeful. Vain hope! The
next two were balls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take your base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now the pitcher got a grip on himself.
One man went down swinging. The next sent
a pop-up into the infield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two down. We got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Meggy screamed.
Johnny was silent. Why did he believe in that
little yellow man? He was plagued by the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! We got &rsquo;em! There he goes!
Down to second. Francois will get him!&rdquo; For
a space of seconds he was sure the game was
over.</p>
<p>Like the steady swing of a pendulum the
catcher&rsquo;s arm went up. The ball sped. It came
exactly where Roger Kreider&rsquo;s mit should
have been. But Roger muffed it. The hard-thrown
ball rolled far into center field. The
runner went on to third. Four more wild ones
and a batter went to first. The next man up
hit one squarely on the nose and boosted it
over the fence for a home run. After that the
Centralia rooters went mad.</p>
<p>Had Hillcrest lost? The fans watched in
grim silence as their team came to bat. It took
but one score to tie, and two to win. But those
scores never came. They went down swinging
bravely, one, two, three. The game was
over. Hillcrest had lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There will be other games,&rdquo; Johnny consoled
the disconsolate Meggy. &ldquo;Many more.&rdquo;
And at that instant he resolved that Colonel
Chamberlain&rsquo;s star pitcher should be in the
box for the next game. &ldquo;Even if I have to
drag him by the heels!&rdquo; he muttered grimly.</p>
<p>But Meggy, staring at him in a strange way,
whispered, &ldquo;Johnny, how did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny replied hoarsely, &ldquo;not
really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he ducked. He saw the little Chinaman
approaching and did not want to be seen
in his company.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the diminutive Tao Sing
caught up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; He was all smiles. &ldquo;I tell you!
I have picture of what you think. I have picture
of what Barney Bradford think too. You
are good friend of Wung Lu.&rdquo; Once again his
voice dropped. &ldquo;Monday I show you picture
of what you think. Four o&rsquo;clock? Heh? Mebby
all right. Heh? You come to Whong Lee&rsquo;s
place, yes? All right. Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>He was gone. Johnny stared after him.
What was it all about? He had to know. He
would be at Whong Lee&rsquo;s place at four on
Monday&mdash;he was sure of that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />THE THOUGHT CAMERA</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I now proceed to take a picture of your
mind.&rdquo; The queer little Chinaman who
called himself Tao Sing twisted his face into a
smile and in doing so added a hundred wrinkles
to the thousand that already made up his
rather comical face.</p>
<p>Four o&rsquo;clock on the Monday following the
ball game had found Johnny at the door of
Whong Lee&rsquo;s little shop asking for Tao Sing.
Tao Sing had said he would show him a picture
of his thoughts. Johnny did not believe
he could do that. However, one of Johnny&rsquo;s
rules for living was, &ldquo;Never pass anything
up.&rdquo; So here he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a picture of my mind?&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that. I still have my head on.
You can&rsquo;t take a picture through my skull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. This I cannot do,&rdquo; the little man said
soberly. &ldquo;But I can make a picture of what
you think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I think,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to himself.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said the other night. Of
course it&rsquo;s nonsense. But he did tell me what
I had thought about the pep meet. He did tell
me what none of our team knew about the ball
game. I&rsquo;m going to find out how he did that
if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you can read my mind?&rdquo; he
said to the little Chinaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot read your mind. No! No!
Not that.&rdquo; The little man&rsquo;s brow puckered
in a comical manner. &ldquo;I can make a picture
of your thoughts. You shall see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Tao Sing twisted a knob on some
small instrument before him on a table. He
punched a button that made a loud click.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he up to?&rdquo; Johnny asked himself.
He had met this man only twice. Knew nothing
of him really. Now in a stuffy little room
in the back of Whong Lee&rsquo;s shop where all
manner of Oriental roots and seeds were sold,
he was listening to strange talk. There was a
druggy smell about the place that made him
slightly dizzy. He wished in a vague sort of
way that he was not there, but being there, decided
to stay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; The little yellow man heaved a
heavy sigh. &ldquo;Now you think. Ah yes, to think
is easy. We always think, except when we
sleep. Then we dream. You do not believe?
Then you try not to think at all. Ah! This
you cannot do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to remember what you thought&mdash;&rdquo; the
little man rattled on, &ldquo;ah, that is more difficult.
But now you must remember. For very soon
I shall show you what you have thought. It
shall be all put down, right in here.&rdquo; He
tapped his instrument. &ldquo;Where I can see it,
read it when I choose. Tomorrow? Yes, in
ten years? Yes. In a hundred years? Yes,
yes, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Johnny
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you shall see!&rdquo; The little man&rsquo;s wrinkled
smile appeared again. &ldquo;Now! Get ready&mdash;think!
I record your thoughts.&rdquo; A second
button clicked, sounding loud in the silent,
drug-scented room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t record much,&rdquo; the boy told himself
stoutly. &ldquo;But of course it&rsquo;s all nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>He put his mind to the task of running over
a song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m riding to the last round-up,</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll saddle Old Paint, and ri&mdash;ide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>What utter nonsense! This little man was
a fake. He could not keep his mind on the
words of that song. A fly caught in a spider&rsquo;s
web buzzed loudly in one corner. He heard
the rustle of rice paper&mdash;Whong Lee wrapping
up some Ginsing roots perhaps.</p>
<p>With a wrench he brought his mind back
to the song:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last round-up, the la&mdash;ast round-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt all sort of stuffed up. Even in the
daytime this place was spooky enough. What
if this little man <i>could</i> read people&rsquo;s minds?
How terrible to have someone about, who
could tell everything you thought! You&rsquo;d just
have to stop thinking, and that was impossible.
Again he was back at the song:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m riding to the last round-up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you may stop thinking,&rdquo; the little
man broke in. &ldquo;Only&mdash;&rdquo; he smiled again.
&ldquo;You will never stop, not for one moment, except
when you are asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said briskly, &ldquo;we take this out.&rdquo;
He held up a round metal box a little larger
than a silver dollar. &ldquo;We fit it in here. We
turn this handle, so&mdash;very slowly, for two
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking out his watch, he proceeded to time
himself while the tiny handle went round and
round noiselessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little Chinaman is a fake,&rdquo; the boy
thought to himself once more. &ldquo;He must be.
How could anyone make a picture of your
thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;he found himself trying to think
what that would mean. If you were able to
photograph the thoughts of your mother on
the night before Christmas, or your teacher
when you thought she had caught you in some
prank, or the person who sits next to you in
a street car, or the new girl next door, or a
person suspected of some terrible crime. Johnny&rsquo;s
head fairly whirled with the possibilities
of the thing. In the end he thought, &ldquo;Huh!
It can&rsquo;t be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beginning to feel that he had dwelt upon
this long enough, he switched his thoughts to
the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Johnny
could visit that fascinating place any time he
pleased because he was a friend of the great
Wung Lu, who spent much time there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>At times Johnny had lived near great forests.
These he had explored with interest. He
had followed mysterious rivers and searched
hidden places in wild mountain ranges. Here
he explored Chinatown.</p>
<p>And such a fascinating place this Chinatown
was&mdash;especially the Chamber of Commerce to
which, from all over the world, rich Chinamen
came that they might trade silk and tea,
quaint Chinese toys, teak wood boxes and a
thousand other articles of trade, for wheat and
typewriters, teaspoons and automobiles.</p>
<p>There were strange and fascinating things
in the great hall of the Chinese Chamber of
Commerce&mdash;a lamp made of three thousand
pieces of porcelain, banners old as the hills
from which they came, and brass dragons that
seemed much older.</p>
<p>Johnny was deep in his contemplation of
these things when the little man who called
himself Tao Sing said, &ldquo;Now then, you shall
see!&rdquo; He heaved a sigh. He snapped his old-fashioned
watch shut. &ldquo;Now we take it out of
here. It is done. Your thoughts, how shall we
say&mdash;they are pickled. They will keep a long,
long time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; He held up a finger. &ldquo;You
shall see these so wonderful thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See.&rdquo; He took a small instrument from a
shelf on the wall. &ldquo;I put it in here. I wind this
so.&rdquo; A clicking sound followed. &ldquo;I press this
so. Now. Now! You look.&rdquo; His tone rose
as he pointed to the top of the instrument resembling
a high power microscope. &ldquo;You look!
You see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did look, and what he saw struck
him dumb. There, passing slowly before his
eyes were words, faintly illuminated words.
Strangest of all, he realized as he read that
these words represented his thoughts of a few
moments before.</p>
<p>The words passed slowly. There was ample
time for reading every one. Yet, so astonished
was he that for a time he did not read. When
at last he got a grip on himself he realized
that here recorded, apparently for all time,
just as a moving picture is recorded, were his
least and most trifling thoughts of a few moments
before. The buzzing fly was there, and
Whong Lee&rsquo;s wrapping of a package. And,
sadly jumbled with the rest, was his thinking
through of that song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>There came a click louder than the rest. The
space beneath his eyes went blank. The show
was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; cried the little man. &ldquo;I have
your thoughts. They are recorded. They will
keep a long, long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To say that Johnny was astonished is to express
his feelings not at all. He looked up at
Tao Sing for all the world as if he had never
seen him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! You are wonderful!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Can you do that again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to see again?&rdquo; The little man
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Oh yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man fingered the microscope affair
for a moment. &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; He stepped back.
&ldquo;You look see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did &ldquo;look see,&rdquo; and the thoughts
that passed through his mind as he looked
were strange indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And yet
it is. A wonderful new invention, like the telegraph,
radio, television. Like all the wonderful
things of our marvelous age.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The words that fell from Tao Sing&rsquo;s lips
as the spot before Johnny&rsquo;s eyes once more
went blank, left him staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to try?&rdquo; said Tao Sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&mdash;try?&rdquo; Johnny stammered at last. &ldquo;Try
to take pictures of people&rsquo;s thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Johnny stared. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;could be more interesting. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh bother!&rdquo; he whispered at last.</p>
<p>Then to the Chinaman, &ldquo;Yes, I sure would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The Chinaman&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.
&ldquo;You do for me, I do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much.&rdquo; Tao Sing&rsquo;s eyes became
mere slits of light. &ldquo;You know Wung Lu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wung Lu very rich, very wise.&rdquo; The little
man&rsquo;s eyes opened suddenly very wide. &ldquo;You
see Wung Lu sit and think long time, eyes
half shut. Think long time. Very wise
thoughts. You take picture of these thoughts.
Tao Sing read thoughts. By and by Tao Sing
very wise. You take picture Wung Lu&rsquo;s
thoughts. You give &rsquo;em to Tao Sing. What?
You take &rsquo;em pictures your friends. All right.
You keep &rsquo;em. What?&rdquo; He looked at the boy
very hard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Johnny stared. Here indeed was a strange
offer. He was to sit in the Chinese Chamber
of Commerce, as he had often sat before, admiring
the ancient, green-eyed dragon, while
Wung Lu, the rich and wise one, sat in his
corner contemplating a large portly Buddha.
He was to take pictures of the wise one&rsquo;s
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wung Lu thinks much.&rdquo; Tao Sing spoke
slowly. &ldquo;He talks little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny knew this to be true. Wung Lu
smiled often. He seldom spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No great thought should be allowed to perish.&rdquo;
The little man was quoting some Chinese
proverb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Johnny quite suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Here, I will show you.&rdquo; Soon
Johnny was lost to the world in his study of
the invention he believed to be the most marvelous
in existence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>A half hour later, as he marched home with
a mysterious package under his arm, his mind
was overflowing with the strangest, weirdest
plans. How many things there were that he
truly wished to know! Now he would get
them from the minds of others without asking
questions. There were secrets too that required
no end of scheming to uncover. Now
it would be no trouble at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those stories I have been planning to
write for the <i>Sentinel</i>!&rdquo; (The <i>Sentinel</i> was the
little city&rsquo;s weekly newspaper.) He was fairly
bubbling over with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Never have
to write them at all now; just prop that old
thought-camera up against the books on my
table, get all set to look right at it, start it going,
think the story through. And there you
have it. All that&rsquo;s left is to copy it down from
the thought picture. How simple! How
grand! How&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. Arrived at his own door,
he had all but tumbled into Meggy Strawn
who had been waiting for him there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meg!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better!&rdquo; Meg exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
waiting half an hour. Doug Danby wants you
to go over to the laboratories with him right
away. Important business. He&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Johnny!&rdquo; Her tone changed. &ldquo;How
queer you look! You must have been seeing a
ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Per-perhaps I have,&rdquo; Johnny said slowly.
&ldquo;A ghost of&mdash;well, never mind of what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, tell me.&rdquo; There was a teasing look
in Meg&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. Perhaps never.&rdquo; Johnny was
through the door and into the house like a
flash.</p>
<p>After hiding the newly acquired thought-camera
in his closet, he tiptoed down the back
stairs, then sped away through the garden and
the back gate toward Doug Danby&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t face those teasing eyes,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Not just yet. I might tell, and that
would be betraying a dark secret, Tao Sing&rsquo;s
and mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />A PLACE OF GREAT MAGIC</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Johnny!&rdquo; Doug Danby exclaimed,
as Johnny came racing into
the Danby&rsquo;s back yard. &ldquo;Where you been?
Gee! You look queer! As if you&rsquo;d been stealin&rsquo;
chickens or something.&rdquo; Doug laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh forget it!&rdquo; Johnny exploded. &ldquo;Here!
Give me your catcher&rsquo;s mask. I&rsquo;ll use it to hide
my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; Doug replied. &ldquo;All self-respecting
secrets carefully guarded&mdash;that&rsquo;s
our motto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; Doug exploded. &ldquo;The Colonel
wants to see us! Guess it&rsquo;s about that pitcher
of his. Bet he&rsquo;ll be with us next Saturday.
And if he is,&mdash;say! Boy! We&rsquo;ll lick &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doug was a fine boy. Johnny liked him a
heap. Tall, slightly angular, like the boy Abe
Lincoln, he was honest, hard-working and full
of droll fun&mdash;just the sort of boy that should
come from a little city like Hillcrest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Together the boys walked rapidly down the
street. They soon caught up with a slow ambling
figure that greeted them with a squawky
but none the less hearty, &ldquo;Why, hello Doug!
Hello Johnny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Professor George, the little city&rsquo;s
favorite old man. He was eighty years old,
was Professor George. The younger men of
the city could remember when he was a popular
teacher in the high school. Now, for years,
he had been Professor George, friend of every
boy in town.</p>
<p>The professor had a hooked nose and there
were huge brown freckles all over his dry face,
but his kindly smile was worth earning, and
many a boy owed his success to Professor
George&rsquo;s kindly, steadying hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry you lost the game Saturday,&rdquo; he said
as he tried hard to keep in step. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
better luck next time. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo; Professor
George had not missed a ball game in
twenty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Doug exclaimed enthusiastically,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to have a grand pitcher, regular
big league stuff! We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>His words were broken in upon by a booming
voice. It was Big Bill Tyson speaking. He
had suddenly appeared from somewhere. &ldquo;Just
the fellows I want to see!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;The
very ones. Wanted to tell you about the ball
grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es. What about it?&rdquo; The words
caught in Doug&rsquo;s throat. He had been dreading
this for some time, in fact ever since Big
Bill&rsquo;s father died. Bill&rsquo;s father had owned the
ball park. He had owned a lot more of the
town besides. Now it all belonged to Big Bill.
Once the ball park had been the grounds of a
canning factory. Bill&rsquo;s father had been rich
and generous, a good citizen and a great friend
of Professor George. So, when the antiquated
canning factory failed to pay, he had allowed
Professor George and his boys to tear it down
and to use the lumber for a fence and bleachers
of a ball park.</p>
<p>But now the good old man was dead and
Big Bill reigned, in his stead. Big Bill was a
different sort. He cared little for boys, in fact
he thought very little about the welfare of anyone
but Big Bill. So now Doug, Johnny and
Professor George stood, inwardly quaking,
awaiting his next word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this&mdash;&rdquo; he tried to be brisk and
business-like, but succeeded only in appearing,
in the boys&rsquo; eyes at least, as a big bully. &ldquo;Like
this&mdash;&rdquo; he began again. &ldquo;Fellow came into my
office last week. He&rsquo;s interested in organizing
a professional baseball league. Hired players
and all that from out of town. Play the games
on Sunday. Big thing for the city. Bring lots
of folks here. Fill up the soft-drink places, pool
halls an&rsquo; all that. Fine big thing!&rdquo; Thrusting
his fingers in his belt, he swelled out like
a turkey gobbler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the boys could play their games on Saturday
just the same,&rdquo; Professor George put in
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. No, they couldn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s what I
wanted to tell you.&rdquo; Big Bill scowled. &ldquo;Boys
would be in the way. Professionals need practice
and all that. So&mdash;it&rsquo;s out you go, just like
that!&rdquo; He snapped a pudgy finger. &ldquo;Unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo; Doug breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you can get me a thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rent?&rdquo; Professor George gasped. &ldquo;We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rent nothing!&rdquo; Big Bill roared. &ldquo;First
payment on a contract to purchase the
grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For&mdash;for how much?&rdquo; Doug was staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand dollars on contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand!&rdquo; Johnny whistled through
his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ll,&rdquo; Professor George said slowly,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a fair price, William. But you&rsquo;ll have
to give us time to think where we can get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Big Bill suddenly put on a business-like
air. &ldquo;Two weeks. Time enough for
anybody.&rdquo; At that he strode away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well make it two years,&rdquo; Doug
grumbled gloomily, &ldquo;for all we&rsquo;ll ever make
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now Doug!&rdquo; Professor George admonished.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a worthy cause, a very worthy
cause. Nothing better for the boys than good,
clean baseball. God loves boys, I&rsquo;m positive of
that. So, just like as not He&rsquo;ll show us the
way.&rdquo; Professor George was religious but he
was not what you call pious. His religion,
like the blood that coursed through his veins,
was a real part of him. Every boy who came
to know him respected him the more because
of his religion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; the good old professor said
as he left them at his own door, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let
William trouble you too much. We&rsquo;ll get
round him somehow. Used to trouble us in
school, William did, but we always got round
him, somehow.&rdquo; He gave forth a cackling
laugh. &ldquo;Always got round him somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill went to school when Professor George
taught,&rdquo; Doug explained as he and Johnny
went on down the street. &ldquo;Dad says Bill
cheated something terrible, but Professor
George always caught on to him. That&rsquo;s why
he don&rsquo;t like Professor George, even now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been cheating ever since,&rdquo; he added
gloomily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll cheat us out of our ball park
if we don&rsquo;t watch out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand dollars,&rdquo; he murmured
thoughtfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got half that much in
the bank&mdash;been saving it for new bleachers.
Took two years to save it. Fine chance to
gather up that much more in two weeks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to advertise,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;This
mysterious new pitcher now. He ought to
draw a crowd if we only had him advertised.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Like a flash a bright idea occurred to Johnny.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think up some good publicity,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;Think it up just right. Then
I&rsquo;ll shoot that thought-camera at myself and
turn out some swell copy. Old C. K. Lovell
will put it in the <i>Sentinel</i>, I know he will.&rdquo; But
of this he said never a word to Doug. The
thought-camera was a deep, dark secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is mysterious!&rdquo; Doug exclaimed quite
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! What? Who&rsquo;s mysterious?&rdquo; Johnny
dragged himself back to earth with a start.
&ldquo;Oh! Yes! That pitcher. Sure he is. Terribly
mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Colonel says he&rsquo;s been working in the
laboratories for three months,&rdquo; Doug broke in.
&ldquo;Three months! I&rsquo;ve been round the lab nearly
every day, and I never once saw him, except
that evening when he pitched a few over for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boys approached the long, low building
known as the laboratories, Johnny felt a
thrill course up his spine. He was to see that
strange pitcher. With his olive skin and bright
gleaming blue eyes, this pitcher&rsquo;s very movements
seemed to say, &ldquo;Here I am. A mystery.
Solve me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>The laboratories too held a special charm
for Johnny. Here all manner of strange chemical
secrets were sought out and often found.
Already these laboratories were famous. Here
a new drug had been discovered that had
proved a great boon to those suffering from
asthma. With characteristic generosity, the
Colonel had given this discovery to the world,
asking no profit to himself.</p>
<p>It was rumored that here a poison had been
discovered, so powerful that it would make
war impossible. One drop of it on any part
of the body would mean instant death. This
was only a rumor. Better founded was the
statement that &ldquo;heavy water&rdquo;&mdash;a water in
which no animal life, however small, could
live&mdash;had been produced. However these
things might be, both Johnny and Doug approached
the place with a feeling akin to awe,
for this to their growing minds was a place
of great magic.</p>
<p>In the office of the laboratories they found
awaiting them not only the Colonel, but a
short, round-shouldered boy who wore heavy
horn-rimmed glasses with thick lenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Goggles!&rdquo; Doug greeted the bespectacled
boy with a hearty grin. &ldquo;What you
doing here? Been discovering some new element
or something?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; he turned to his friend. &ldquo;Meet
Goggles Short, the boy wizard, both chemical
and electrical, of our fair city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw now!&rdquo; Goggles was embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fame,&rdquo; said the Colonel with a cordial
smile, &ldquo;is a terribly embarrassing thing, Goggles.
However, since you have attained it,
you&rsquo;ll have to bear up under it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think&mdash;&rdquo; the Colonel&rsquo;s tone
changed as he wheeled about to face the other
boys, &ldquo;I suppose you think that I sent for you
to talk about our new pitcher. I did not. He
is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here!&rdquo; Doug&rsquo;s face dropped. &ldquo;Gone
for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not for good,&rdquo; the Colonel broke in.
&ldquo;Just for a day or two. He&rsquo;ll be back for Saturday&rsquo;s
game. I&rsquo;m ready to guarantee that.
And you boys are going to need him&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo;
his voice dropped, &ldquo;for more reasons than
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Big Bill&rsquo;s plans.&rdquo; Doug&rsquo;s face
took on a hopeful look. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="gs">Yes</span>.&rdquo; The Colonel spoke slowly. &ldquo;Only
moral and mental support, however. Cash is
all tied up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll lick Big Bill, I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo; the
Colonel&rsquo;s tone carried conviction. &ldquo;Goggles
here has an idea. Sit down.&rdquo; He motioned
them to chairs. &ldquo;Goggles, tell them about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo; Goggles pulled at
his sleeve nervously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of like this.
Maybe it won&rsquo;t help a bit. But this is it. Dave
Saunders over at the electric shop has been
experimenting with a thing. I&rsquo;ve been helping
him. Thing&rsquo;s got eyes, better&rsquo;n human
eyes because they&rsquo;re quicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Electric eyes,&rdquo; Johnny put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; eyes
bulged behind his thick lenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know a lot about them,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled.
&ldquo;Sometime I&rsquo;ll tell you about how a fellow
talked to me down a beam of light. Electric
eyes helped him to do that, and a lot of
exciting things happened. But go on. What
you using electric eyes for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umpire,&rdquo; Goggles said with a broad grin.
&ldquo;Baseball umpire. Got forty eyes. Some see
up and down and some sideways. We&rsquo;ve tried
it out. Works swell. Calls balls and strikes
perfectly. Never a miss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thing is&mdash;&rdquo; Goggles hurried on. &ldquo;A week
from Wednesday we play Fairfield. That
team&rsquo;s always beefing about the umpire. Holler
their heads off. So I thought&mdash;&rdquo; he took
a long breath, &ldquo;thought you might like to try
our old electric umpire. He&rsquo;ll umpire fairly.
Never a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; Doug sprang to his feet, &ldquo;that
would be swell! And man! Oh, man! We&rsquo;ll
draw a crowd! Think of it! Something absolutely
new. Electric umpire! What do you
think of it, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;think of what?&rdquo; Johnny started.
&ldquo;Electric eye. Oh! Yes, it&rsquo;s interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! More than that!&rdquo; Doug exploded.
&ldquo;Electric umpire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth was, strange as it may seem, Johnny&rsquo;s
mind had gone off the track. It had suddenly
been deflected by the thought-camera,
the most extraordinary thing he had ever
seen. &ldquo;I dreamed it,&rdquo; he had been telling himself.
&ldquo;Thing never happened. That Chinaman
never recorded my thoughts. But if he did,
if the thing&rsquo;s in my closet when I get home,
I&rsquo;ll try it&mdash;like to try it now.&rdquo; This was what
he had been thinking when Doug Danby
brought him back to his present surroundings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swell idea!&rdquo; he enthused, once the electric
umpire had been explained to him. &ldquo;Work all
right, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And draw a crowd,&rdquo; put in Doug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking,&rdquo; Colonel
Chamberlain agreed. &ldquo;Paying crowds are
what you need right now. You&rsquo;ll get that extra
five hundred dollars in plenty of time. All
you need is advertising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me.&rdquo; Johnny was on his feet,
ready for a dash home. With the aid of the
thought-camera, he would dish up plenty of
fancy advertising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Doug agreed, &ldquo;you look after
that. I&rsquo;ll get in touch with the Fairfield bunch.
See if they&rsquo;ll stand for this electric umpire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll stand for it right enough,&rdquo; the
Colonel said with a smile. &ldquo;They get a percentage
of the gate receipts. Just talk publicity
to them and they&rsquo;ll agree readily
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; his tone became brisk. &ldquo;Council
of war is over. I&rsquo;ll have my pitcher on hand
for Saturday&rsquo;s major attraction. And you,
Goggles, you&rsquo;ll take care of Wednesday.
Meeting&rsquo;s adjourned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>With a &ldquo;Thank you, thank you a lot!&rdquo; the
three boys filed out of the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Doug sighed, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t see him
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See who?&rdquo; Johnny was once more lost in
his contemplation of the immediate future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pitcher, of course,&rdquo; Doug grumbled.
&ldquo;Fellow&rsquo;d think he was just an ordinary person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps he is,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps he is not,&rdquo; Doug replied as
they lost themselves in the gathering darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />JOHNNY&rsquo;S THINK-O-GRAPHS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to himself as
he thrust his hand deep into a dark
corner of his closet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still there. The
thought-camera is no dream. But will it record
thoughts for me? That&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found himself all aquiver with excitement.
He was like a very small boy with his
very first camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to try it on myself,&rdquo; he thought. Then,
recalling the little Chinaman&rsquo;s test and the
sadly muddled thoughts the camera had
brought out, he, for the time at least, abandoned
that plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s grandfather,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;He
sits by the hour every evening, looking off into
the night and thinking. Wonder what those
thoughts are like. I&rsquo;d really like to know.
That&mdash;that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll try it first.&rdquo; He hurried
downstairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Johnny was very fond of the stalwart old
man he called grandfather. A pioneer of his
small city, he had seen much of life. At times
he talked of those days long gone by. For the
most part he sat in his great chair on the
broad porch and gazed away into the darkness
toward the spot where, in the daytime, the
blue began.</p>
<p>Slipping silently into a chair close to the
old man, Johnny touched the release to the
thought-camera. There followed a low buzzing
sound. Johnny&rsquo;s heart leaped. The camera
was working. But was it recording
thoughts, his grandfather&rsquo;s thoughts? Only
time would tell.</p>
<p>For several moments in the night, disturbed
only by the cricket&rsquo;s chirp and the distant
bullfrog&rsquo;s hoarse croak, the pair sat there motionless.</p>
<p>Then the old man stirred. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that,
Johnny?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice trembled
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds a little like a new sort of cricket,&rdquo;
the old man rumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I guess.&rdquo; Johnny snapped off his
thought-camera. The sound ceased. &ldquo;Well,
guess I&rsquo;ll go up,&rdquo; he said in as steady a tone as
he could command. &ldquo;Goodnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy fairly ran up the stairs. He was
obliged to drop into a chair in his room to calm
himself. Then, after shaking his fingers to
loosen their tenseness, he went about the business
of the hour.</p>
<p>Having removed the small cartridge containing
the long, thread-like film, he set it revolving
in that other magic box that was supposed
to develop and finish it. Two minutes
of this and the thing was done. Or was it?</p>
<p>Drawing one long deep breath, Johnny
placed the film in the microscope-like affair,
then started the mechanism.</p>
<p>For ten seconds he stood there squinting
into the brass tube, spellbound. Then he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Hot diggity dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, for a full fifteen minutes his
thoughts were focussed upon the thing before
him. In that quarter hour he ran the film
through three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he murmured as at last he sank
into a chair, &ldquo;nothing could be half so marvelous!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>And indeed it <i>was</i> marvelous for there,
stripped of all the backwardness and timidity
that so often hamper the speech of old men,
were recorded the golden thoughts of one
grand old man as he dreamed of the glorious
pioneer days that are gone forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll copy it,&rdquo; Johnny told himself, &ldquo;then
I&rsquo;ll have it printed in the <i>Sentinel</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he amended, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do better than that.
I&rsquo;ll record his thoughts night after night.
They&rsquo;ll never be the same. It will make a
book. And such a book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he sat for a long time dreaming of
the marvelous things he would do with that
thought-camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it belongs to Tao Sing,&rdquo; he reminded
himself. &ldquo;Only he knows the secret of it. How
long am I to have it? As long as I fulfill Tao
Sing&rsquo;s wishes I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, with a shudder he could not entirely
explain, he recalled his promise to Tao Sing.
He was to carry the camera to the Chinese
Chamber of Commerce. He was to point it at
his friend, the rich Chinese merchant Wung
Lu, and record his thoughts for Tao Sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo; Disturbing thought!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think-o-graphs,&rdquo; he whispered to himself
before he fell asleep that night. &ldquo;Good name
for them, all right. A picture of your face is
a photograph, so, naturally a picture of your
thoughts is a think-o-graph. There now!&rdquo; he
chuckled to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve coined a brand new
word. And if this thought-camera comes to
be a common possession as ordinary cameras
are, it will be a very popular word. If it does&mdash;&rdquo;
he repeated slowly.</p>
<p>He tried to think what the world would be
like if anyone who wished it might have a
thought-camera and photograph other people&rsquo;s
thoughts. There would not remain in the
world one secret that could be kept, that was
certain. All the secrets between nations would
be at an end. Spies would lose their jobs. No
criminal could escape revealing his innermost
thoughts. The whole thing made him slightly
dizzy, so he gave over thinking about it, and
fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />BESIDE THE GREEN-EYED DRAGON</h2>
<p>The days that followed were strange ones
for Johnny. At the very beginning, in his
enthusiasm for a new and quite wonderful
thing, he nearly gave the secret of the thought-camera
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny for your thoughts!&rdquo; he said as he
met Meggy Strawn on the street the very next
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a dollar!&rdquo; Meg exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I shall have them!&rdquo; declared
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never shall!&rdquo; Meg laughed in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have them right now,&rdquo; Johnny said in a
mysterious tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring them round later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>He did too. The result was rather surprising.
As Meg read her own thoughts, copied
by Johnny from the thought picture he had
taken, she gave him a startled look. &ldquo;Why
you&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off to stare at him for all the
world as if she had never seen him before. For
a full moment after that neither of them spoke.
When Meg at last broke the silence, it was in
a queer small voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, don&rsquo;t ever do that again! I don&rsquo;t
know how you did it&mdash;you don&rsquo;t need to tell.
But never, never, never do it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny said soberly. &ldquo;Here!
Shake on it!&rdquo; Their hands clasped for a space
of seconds. Then, without another word, each
turned and went his own way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment.
&ldquo;Swell way to lose a good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His experiment in recording his own
thoughts worked out in a more satisfactory
manner. Having built up in his own mind a
tale of mystery about the new pitcher and,
having visited the electric shop and watched
Goggles&rsquo; mechanical umpire with forty eyes
perform, he hurried home, set up the camera,
then fixing his thoughts on the publicity he
wished to create for the two ball games, he sat
quite still, staring at the wall for a full ten
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he breathed at last. &ldquo;The cake is
done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>With ever increasing enthusiasm he developed
and copied his own personal think-o-graph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! This is great!&rdquo; He paused at last to
gloat over the nearly finished product. &ldquo;Am I
the thinker! If only I could write as well as I
think I&rsquo;d become a great author right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carried his stories of the two approaching
ball games to the slow-going, genial editor
of the weekly paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see it.&rdquo; The editor put on his glasses.
&ldquo;Same old stuff I suppose. Have to do it all
over before I run it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is.&rdquo; Johnny gave himself a mental
hug.</p>
<p>A moment later he saw the editor pouring
eagerly over his copy. &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; the editor
exclaimed under his breath. Then, &ldquo;Great
Jehosophat, Johnny! Didn&rsquo;t know you had it
in you! Been seein&rsquo; you around your grand-pap&rsquo;s
for a good many years. What paper you
been workin&rsquo; on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No paper.&rdquo; Johnny grinned broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m surprised, Johnny. This is fine
copy. Run it just as it is. Get you some fine
crowds. I&rsquo;ll say it will!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Want you to know, Johnny,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;Want all the boys to know this paper&rsquo;s for
&rsquo;em. We want you to have that ball field, have
it always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than&mdash;thanks, C.K.,&rdquo; Johnny stammered.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look here, son!&rdquo; The editor put a hand
on his shoulder. &ldquo;This stuff shows real talent.
Keep on writing like this and you&rsquo;ll get somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny had it on the end of his tongue
to say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t write it.&rdquo; Fake glory was one
thing Johnny had never craved. But then, if
he did not write it, who did? That would require
much explaining. He decided to leave
well enough alone. &ldquo;I&mdash;I thank you,&rdquo; he muttered
uncertainly. Then he was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>That evening he went to the Chinese Chamber
of Commerce and sat near to the rich and
silent wise one, Wung Lu, for a long time. He
liked this quiet place, full of treasures from the
past. He loved to sit looking at that green-eyed
dragon more than two thousand years
old. He wondered what those green eyes could
have seen when the world was very young.
He wondered many things. But he did not forget
to point his thought-camera at the silent,
wise Wung Lu and to record his thoughts. He
wondered what those thoughts were. This was
not given to him to know. Wung Lu thought
in Chinese. Only Tao Sing would read these.
This made Johnny uneasy. He was almost
ready to return the thought-camera to its owner&mdash;almost
but not quite.</p>
<p>There were many things that might be done
with that thought-camera. There were mysteries
to be solved. Perhaps some day he
would point it at that strange pitcher over at
the laboratories. He wanted terribly to know
his secret. And yet&mdash;one does not spy upon
his friends. This young man promised to become
a friend of Hillcrest and that meant he
must be Johnny&rsquo;s friend as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it for
another day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carried the small round box containing
the rich Wung Lu&rsquo;s think-o-graph to the little
room at the back of the Chinese spice store.
There, in the semi-darkness, Tao Sing&rsquo;s claw-like
hand grasped it with such a nervous tenseness
that Johnny was actually startled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good! Very good!&rdquo; the little Chinaman
cackled. &ldquo;You will go again and again.
Wung Lu is very wise. Soon we shall all be
wise. Here are more&mdash;many more.&rdquo; He
pressed a bag of small metal boxes into Johnny&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>As Johnny left the place to step into the cool
air of night, he felt himself all but over-powered
by a strange sense of Oriental intrigue
and mystery. &ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing
any of this,&rdquo; he told himself. In the end, however,
he succeeded in overcoming his misgivings.</p>
<p>The day for their second battle with the
Centralia baseball team approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo; Johnny said to Meggy Strawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to,&rdquo; was Meggy&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>Johnny wondered if the thought-camera
would help any. &ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; was his final
decision. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll take it along anyway, just
for company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three times that week he sat in the great
room with Wung Lu and the ancient dragon.
Each time his uneasiness grew. Each time that
he delivered the think-o-graphs, as he had
come to call them, to the wrinkled Tao Sing,
the little man&rsquo;s enthusiasm increased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wung Lu&rsquo;s thoughts must be very wonderful,&rdquo;
was the boy&rsquo;s mental comment. &ldquo;And
yet&mdash;&rdquo; one more shudder. &ldquo;Could it be that
Tao Sing was learning things he had no right
to know? And was he, Johnny, assisting him?&rdquo;
The thought gave him a start. &ldquo;Secrets,&rdquo; he
whispered, &ldquo;sometimes I think they&rsquo;re no
good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>

<br />MYSTERY SHIP</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get over the way that pitcher
came to us,&rdquo; Goggles Short murmured
low to Johnny Thompson. They were seated
in the bleachers. The Saturday game was
about to begin. The new pitcher from the
laboratories, cap drawn low, eyes gleaming,
was putting over a few to the catcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> strange,&rdquo; Johnny said. &ldquo;Prince of India!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;I gave him that name
and I&rsquo;m proud of it.&rdquo; In his publicity produced
by the thought-camera Johnny had
played up the name &ldquo;Prince of India.&rdquo; He
liked the sound of it. &ldquo;He looks the part too!
Look at that slim nose of his,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;those thin lips, that high forehead. You&rsquo;d
take him for a Frenchman, or perhaps an Englishman,
if it weren&rsquo;t for that dark skin of his.
If he&rsquo;s not a Prince of India, he should be.
Watch him pitch!&rdquo; The slender man on the
mound, moving with the smooth agility of a
cat, seemed to fairly slide the ball over the
plate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the crowd!&rdquo; Goggles cried. &ldquo;And
is it a crowd! That publicity stuff of yours
was great! We&rsquo;ll get nearly half the money
we need for that first payment today. And
Wednesday! It&rsquo;s in the bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure,&rdquo; Johnny warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to that crowd!&rdquo; Goggles exclaimed
once more.</p>
<p>Led by Meggy Strawn, a streak of gold and
blue that danced across the grass, the crowd
was chanting:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>A Prince! A Prince! A Prince!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>No quince! No quince! No quince!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>A Peach! A Peach! A Peach!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>We win! Yea! Yea!</i></p>
</div>
<p>As for the &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he seemed totally unconscious
of his surroundings as he slid one
more stinger over the plate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> strange,&rdquo; Johnny said to Goggles,
&ldquo;strange about that pitcher, I mean. Colonel
Chamberlain has had him working in his laboratories
for more than three months. The
pay-roll proves that. But who knew it? The
pay-master and Colonel Chamberlain, that&rsquo;s
all. Queer, isn&rsquo;t it? And now, when everything
seems lost for old Hillcrest, he walks
right into the picture. He takes the ball, and
whang! How it pops into that old mit! Not
a man will get to first. See! There goes one
of &rsquo;em. Three strikes and out. Great, I&rsquo;d say!
Suppose he can keep it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not wait for an answer. Instead, he
allowed his eyes to seek a spot in the sky.
Something up there interested him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not coming
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s not coming down?&rdquo; Goggles asked
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That airplane. It&rsquo;s been circling way up
high there for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope it wouldn&rsquo;t come down,&rdquo;
Goggles laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye
think? Think they&rsquo;d come right on down and
land square in the middle of the ball field?&rdquo;
He laughed again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Johnny did not reply. Truth was, he did
not know what he had expected. It was
strange about that airplane. He had been
watching it off and on for twenty minutes. All
that time it had been circling above the ball
field. At first it had seemed little more than
a speck against the dull gray of a leaden sky.
Moment by moment it had circled lower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw an eagle do that once,&rdquo; he had told
himself as a little thrill ran up his spine. &ldquo;Old
eagle soared and soared and soared until he
was maybe a hundred feet from the ground.
Then he folded his wings and dropped. And
such a drop! Straight down! When he came
up he held a half-grown rabbit in his talons.
He&rsquo;d had his eye on that rabbit all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as he watched the airplane
circle above the ball field where two fine
teams were contending for high honors, fantastic
as it might seem, he had gained the impression
that this plane, circling as the eagle
had circled, would in the end make one
straight drop to the ball field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; he whispered to himself.
&ldquo;Why should they do that? Crack up! Everyone
in the plane would be killed. Eagle&rsquo;s a
different sort of bird. He could recover balance
and rise again. That plane&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>All the same, the impression remained a
haunting suggestion until, with the end of the
first half, a shut-out for the opposing team, the
Centralia boys went trotting off the field. Only
then did the airplane go skimming away into
the hazy distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if the eagle had been watching the
rabbit only to see the rabbit scurry into his
hole,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rabbit will come out again? Another
inning?&rdquo; a voice seemed to whisper in
his ear.</p>
<p>With that, for a time at least, he forgot the
strange airplane and gave his attention to the
ball game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Meggy,&rdquo; he said a moment later as
she slid into the place beside him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going
to win, Meg!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Meg&rsquo;s voice was low. &ldquo;Yes, we must, Johnny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Meggy pinched Johnny&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;Look! He&mdash;he&rsquo;s up to bat! Isn&rsquo;t he mysterious!
The&mdash;the &lsquo;Prince of India&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
they call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Johnny&rsquo;s eye was on the ball.
The opposing pitcher shot it through to the
Prince, but it went high and wide. The dark-faced
one never moved a muscle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Believe he can bat,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s mental
comment. His practiced eye swept over the
diamond. Arthur Lowe was on first, Fred
Frame on second. There were two men out.
No score on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;just one
good swat! That&rsquo;s all we need! Get a grand
lead! We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish. Came the crack of a bat
and the ball went soaring high and far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea! Yea! Yea!&rdquo; The crowd sprang to its
feet and howled madly. &ldquo;Yea! Yea! Yea!
Prince! Prince! Prince!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the crowd settled back to its seats
the new pitcher was on third base. Two men
had come romping home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two to nothing!&rdquo; Meg exulted. &ldquo;Watch
us climb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Artie Snow was up next. He swung
wildly and fanned. The inning was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Johnny stretched himself. &ldquo;Looks
as if we&rsquo;d lick &rsquo;em all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All Meggy said was, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he mysterious?&rdquo;
She was thinking of the &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as her mood changed, Meggy seized
her megaphone and, grasping Johnny by the
arm, screamed, &ldquo;Come on! Cart wheels!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Johnny had done cart wheels with Meggy
on many another occasion, but always in private.
But now! Oh well, Meg was Meg. Her
word was law. Cart wheels it was, an even
dozen, then a rousing cheer led by Meg:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Yea! Hillcrest! Yea! Hillcrest!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Beat &rsquo;em! Beat &rsquo;em! Beat &rsquo;em!</i></p>
</div>
<p>Scarcely had Johnny got his breath than he
discovered that the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; was once more
on the mound, the second inning about to begin.
Quite automatically his eyes swept the
sky. They came to a focus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The airplane!&rdquo; he whispered excitedly.
&ldquo;Like the eagle, it is circling back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was strange the excitement this stirred
up within his being. Why was it? It seemed
absurd, yet in his soul there was a feeling that
the dark pitcher must hurry, that the men who
came up to bat must go down as they had before,
one, two, three, or else the eagle would
drop. &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; he muttered once
more.</p>
<p>For all that, the airplane did circle lower
and lower. There was too in the mysterious
pitcher&rsquo;s action a suggestion of tense nervousness
that was hard to explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>A bat cracked. A ball popped into the air.
The pitcher had it. One man down.</p>
<p>A second man came up. Ball! Strike! Ball!
Crack! Up went the ball again. Down it came,
right into that pitching wizard&rsquo;s mit. Two
out.</p>
<p>The plane circled lower. In the damp,
cloudy air it seemed nearer than it really was.</p>
<p>Third man to bat. Strike! Strike! Strike!
You&rsquo;re out!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like that!&rdquo; Johnny exulted. He did not
so much as glance at the plane. He knew that
once again it had gone skimming away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s strange?&rdquo; Meggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;everything,&rdquo; he evaded, &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s
strange today.&rdquo; How could he tell Meggy of
this fantastic daydream?</p>
<p>Again the opposing team took their places
in the field. Once more Hillcrest came to bat.
And how they did bat! Inspired by rosy
dreams of victory, they sent the ball spinning,
right, left and center. By the time Centralia
had them stopped, the score stood 5 to 0 in
favor of Hillcrest, and the crowd had gone
mad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo; Meggy screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo; Goggles roared.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, he merely murmured,
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wait was destined to be longer than he
dreamed it might be. Four wild balls put the
lead-off man of Centralia on first with no one
out.</p>
<p>It was then that Johnny once more began
noticing that haunting airplane. It had returned.
Once again it was circling downward.</p>
<p>The mysterious pitcher was slipping, there
could be no doubting this. A hard-hit liner put
the second batter on base.</p>
<p>Then the pitcher seemed to tighten up. He
fanned the third man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that plane!&rdquo; Johnny was truly startled
now. The plane did actually seem to be in
a nose-dive. Down, down, down it came,
straight at that lone figure, the pitcher, on the
mound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they&mdash;&rdquo; In his excitement Johnny
stood up. He crushed his cap within his tight
clenched hands. &ldquo;No! No! Thank&mdash;&rdquo; He did
not finish. With a burst of speed, a thunder
of motors, the airplane righted itself, then shot
upward. But what was that? Did Johnny&rsquo;s
eyes deceive him? Did he catch a gleam of fire&mdash;or
was it only a brilliant flash of light? Half
unconsciously he waited the report of a shot
fired. It did not come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest thing!&rdquo; he murmured as
he settled back in his place. Already the airplane
was a long way off.</p>
<p>So filled was the boy&rsquo;s mind with wild speculations
that he failed to follow the game. Perhaps
this was just as well. Dame Fortune appeared
to have deserted the mysterious pitcher.
He walked another man. The bases were
full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at him,&rdquo; Meggy whispered in
Johnny&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Look at him wind up! You&rsquo;d
think he was doing it in his sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, as Johnny focussed his attention
upon this mysterious stranger, he appeared to
waver, as if he might fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something awfully queer about that,&rdquo;
Johnny murmured.</p>
<p>With what appeared to be tremendous effort
the pitcher hurled the ball. It would have cut
the plate squarely in the middle had not a
stout bat met it to send it high and far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>When the commotion was over, the score
stood 5 to 6 in favor of Centralia. There were
men on second and third. What was more, the
&ldquo;Prince&rdquo; was walking unsteadily toward the
bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Meggy exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re calling
for Fred Frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something queer about that!&rdquo; Johnny repeated
as he turned to watch the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo;
walk away toward the showers. &ldquo;The eagle
swooped downward, and now&mdash;&rdquo; he did not
finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He walks as if he were half blind. Poor
&lsquo;Prince!&rsquo;&rdquo; Meg sympathized. &ldquo;What could
have happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny would have given much to know the
answer. For some time to come it was to remain
a veiled secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery ship,&rdquo; Johnny thought as he
watched that airplane glide away toward the
clouds. Then he murmured low, &ldquo;Mystery
wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mystery wings!&rsquo; What makes you say
that?&rdquo; Meg whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s the way I think of a plane,&rdquo;
he replied soberly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say the planes
of an airplane. Don&rsquo;t sound right. Why not
wings of a plane? And, for my part, every
plane that passes over my head has wings of
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re queer,&rdquo; was Meg&rsquo;s only reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />STRANGE PASSENGERS</h2>
<p>Among the Hillcrest fans feeling was running
high. That something strange and
rather terrible had happened to their new and
quite marvelous pitcher, they appeared to
realize. &ldquo;But what did happen?&rdquo; they were
asking. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to blame? Who were the men
in that plane?&rdquo; Two men had been seen. They
were not close enough to be recognized. Had
the Centralia crowd hired them to heckle the
new pitcher? This they found it difficult to
believe. The friendliest of relations had always
existed between the two small cities, even
though there was a keen rivalry. &ldquo;But who?
Who? Who?&rdquo; they were asking on every side.
The mystery of the dark-skinned pitcher from
the laboratories deepened.</p>
<p>As for Doug Danby, on whose shoulders
rested Hillcrest&rsquo;s hopes of victory, he found no
time for solving mysteries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fred, old boy,&rdquo; he said to Fred Frame,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to go in there and win the game.
And you can!&rdquo; He gave him a slap on the
back. &ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my arm holds out,&rdquo; Fred finished.</p>
<p>Tall, angular, red-headed, silent and droll,
Fred was a universal favorite. He had been a
successful pitcher until his arm had taken to
going wrong. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;and
do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud cheer greeted him as he walked toward
the mound. Despite all this, he felt a
chill run up his spine. The score stood 6 to 5
against him. This wonderful crowd had turned
out to see their team win. They had banked
heavily on the mysterious &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo; In this
they had lost. Would they lose the game as
well?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if <i>I</i> can help it!&rdquo; Fred set his teeth
hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if that plane returns?&rdquo; He shuddered.
&ldquo;What if they do to me the thing they
did to the &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; whatever that was! Oh
well!&rdquo; He set his shoulders squarely.</p>
<p>But now the shouts of the throng brought
him back to earth. Motioning the batter to
one side, he prepared to &ldquo;throw a few over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>As his hand grasped the ball, as his muscles
began playing like iron bands, as the ball went
speeding to cut the plate and land with a loud
plop in the catcher&rsquo;s mit, all else but the game
was forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must win!&rdquo; He set his lips tight.</p>
<p>And indeed they must. They had lost one
game, could not afford to lose another.</p>
<p>That he was in a hard spot he knew quite
well. With the score standing 6 to 5 against
him, with men on second and third and only
one man out, the game might be lost with a
single crack of the bat. It was with a rapidly
beating heart that he motioned the batter up.</p>
<p>Yet, even as his arm went back, two questions
flashed through his mind: &ldquo;Who is this
&lsquo;Prince&rsquo;? What happened that after such a
brilliant start he was unable to finish?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something queer!&rdquo; he muttered for the
third time as he sent the ball spinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball!&rdquo; the umpire called.</p>
<p>Then, like a bolt from the blue came a
thought. He made a sign to the catcher. They
met half way between the mound and the
home plate. After a few whispered words they
parted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Fred&rsquo;s second offering went very wide of
the plate. He did not seem to care. Then, just
as he wound up for the third pitch, someone
caught on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to walk that batter!&rdquo; a big voice
bellowed from the bleachers of the opposing
team. &ldquo;Big League stuff! Walking Billy to
get at Vern!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once there was a mad roar that ended in
hisses and boos.</p>
<p>Little Fred cared for that. If he wished to
walk Centralia&rsquo;s toughest batter to get at a
weak one, it was his privilege. &ldquo;And after
that?&rdquo; an Imp seemed to be whispering in his
ear. All the same the passed batter went down
to first. The bags were loaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I slip now&mdash;&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Just listen
to them howl!&rdquo; He gripped the ball hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! He&rsquo;s got a rubber arm!&rdquo; a big voice
roared as the umpire called another ball.</p>
<p>There was silence as Fred slipped over a
strike.</p>
<p>Again that roar with the second ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; the big voice roared. &ldquo;Two
and three! Let&rsquo;s see you get out of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred caught his breath. Bases full. Three
balls, two strikes, and&mdash;&ldquo;If only the old soup-bone
holds out!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>His hand went out. It came back. He shot
the ball straight from the shoulder. Then,
without knowing why, he followed the ball.
Lucky break! The batter connected. He sent
a bouncer straight into Fred&rsquo;s mitt and he half
way to the plate. With a mad dash he was
there to cut off the run to the plate. Next he
sent the ball speeding to first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double play! Double play!&rdquo; the crowd
roared. And so it was. The inning was over.
For the moment, at least, all was well.</p>
<p>Inspired by his unusual success in pulling
his team out of the hole, Fred pitched the remaining
innings with the skill of a genius. He
allowed only five hits, and left but three men
on base. Hillcrest scored three runs in the
seventh, to cinch the game. In the end Fred
was carried from the field in triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another big day Wednesday, and we&rsquo;ll
win!&rdquo; exulted Doug Danby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too much excited,&rdquo; he warned
Johnny and Meg as they came rushing up to
congratulate him. &ldquo;This is not the end. It is
only the beginning. We must win again and
again. It&rsquo;s going to take a real campaign to
gain our end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; Johnny laughed. &ldquo;The way
Fred pitched those last innings, there&rsquo;s not a
team that can stop us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; It was Fred
who spoke. He had just come up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Johnny asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Fred paused to ponder. &ldquo;Well,
you know there are times when you do things
and you say to yourself, &lsquo;I can do this as
often as I choose.&rsquo; Then there are times when
you feel all sort of lifted out of yourself and
you do things well without seeming to try.
But when it&rsquo;s all over you say, &lsquo;That was
great! But I better never try that again. If
I do, I&rsquo;ll fail.&rsquo; This afternoon was just like
that. Johnny, I wouldn&rsquo;t like to face that situation
again, ever!&rdquo; Fred&rsquo;s tone was so serious
that for a full moment no one spoke.</p>
<p>It was Fred himself who at last broke that
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But then, there&rsquo;ll not be the need.&rdquo; He
smiled. &ldquo;Our old friend, the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; will lead
us to sure victory next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Prince&rsquo;!&rdquo; Doug turned to Meggy.
&ldquo;Where did your uncle find him, Meggy? Who
is he? Where&rsquo;s he been hiding?&rdquo; Meggy was
Colonel Chamberlain&rsquo;s favorite niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Meggy admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your uncle said he&rsquo;d been working
down at his laboratories for more than three
months!&rdquo; Johnny protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; Meggy replied slowly, &ldquo;and I suppose
that should make him my first cousin!
But it doesn&rsquo;t. I never saw him before, nor
heard of him either. Uncle doesn&rsquo;t tell me
much about the laboratories. There are always
so many secret investigations going on
down there, so many processes being developed&mdash;things
he can&rsquo;t talk about&mdash;that&mdash;well,
I guess he thinks it&rsquo;s best to say nothing at all
about any of it. And I suppose,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;this pitcher is just one more secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would he hide out so?&rdquo; Doug
Danby asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just doesn&rsquo;t wish to be recognized,
that&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; Johnny said in a tone that carried
conviction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a town like this?&rdquo; Doug exclaimed. &ldquo;It
sure does seem strange!&rdquo; Had he but known
it, those were the very words that were passing
from lip to lip all over this quiet little city.
&ldquo;A strange pitcher! A mysterious dark
stranger! And in a town like this!&rdquo; That was
what they were saying. And, almost without
exception, the answer was, &ldquo;Just think, in a
town like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well anyway,&rdquo; Fred said, &ldquo;he <i>can</i> pitch!
And that&rsquo;s just what we need. We&rsquo;ll just have
to have him next Wednesday when we go
against Fairfield. They&rsquo;re the toughest battling
bunch we&rsquo;ll play for a long time. You
can&rsquo;t count on me to lick them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; only lasted two and a half innings,&rdquo;
Doug suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but some&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny did not finish.
What he started to say was, &ldquo;Something
rather terrible happened to him.&rdquo; After all,
he had only guessed that; could not prove it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny said, &ldquo;I gotta be anklin&rsquo; on
home. Goodbye, Meggy. Goodbye, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later he was seated on a ridge
that lay above the town. Beneath him was a
long, low building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The laboratories!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Place
of mystery. Home of the mysterious &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His whole being was stirred. It was not that
he suspected any wrong of those who worked
behind heavily glazed windows in the laboratories.
Far from that. Colonel Chamberlain
had always been counted among Hillcrest&rsquo;s
foremost citizens. The laboratories belonged
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to hunt up Goggles,&rdquo; Johnny told
himself. &ldquo;Wonder where he went? He always
knows a lot. He may know more than I do
about this pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goggles was a thinker. He was the only
boy ever entrusted with Colonel Chamberlain&rsquo;s
secrets. He alone, of all the town&rsquo;s boys, had
crossed the threshold of the laboratories. Only
he had seen something of that which went on
inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They test all sorts of things in there,&rdquo; he
had confided to Johnny one day, &ldquo;soap and
silk, dyes, and all sorts of powerful drugs.
They try to find things out, to do things that
have never been done before, like making rubber
out of crude petroleum or paper out of sunflower
stalks. They succeed sometimes, too.
See!&rdquo; He had pulled a sheet of paper from
his pocket. &ldquo;Made from a sunflower stalk.
Pretty good paper, eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they make a real discovery,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;they sell it to some great manufacturer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Chamberlain&mdash;&rdquo; he had taken a
deep breath. &ldquo;He showed me a lot of things
I can&rsquo;t talk about. He says maybe some day
I can work with him in the laboratories. Boy!
Won&rsquo;t that be grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Goggles knows
something about this &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo;&rdquo; Johnny said
to himself now.</p>
<p>He broke short off to stare down at the laboratories.
Someone had come walking down
the gravel path. He walked slowly. &ldquo;Seems
to drag his feet,&rdquo; Johnny whispered. Just then
the newcomer looked up toward the sun. Johnny
got a full view of his slim, dark face. It
was the &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo; A moment more and the long,
low place of mysteries had swallowed him up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>That evening Johnny searched in vain for
Goggles. Goggles&rsquo; mother did not know where
he was, nor did anyone else. Johnny decided to
go on a little detective cruise all by himself.
Mounting his bicycle, he rode east nine miles
to the Shady Valley landing field. In the office
he found two men in aviators&rsquo; uniforms playing
checkers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he said in a subdued voice, &ldquo;Did any
of you fly a plane over the Hillcrest ball field
this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo; The younger of the two men
looked up quickly. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing I guess.&rdquo; Johnny dropped into
a seat prepared to watch the game.</p>
<p>Though for a full quarter hour he said never
a word, the young aviator looked at Johnny
in a queer way many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about it?&rdquo; he said, turning to
Johnny when the game was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I guess,&rdquo; Johnny repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>was</i> a queer business,&rdquo; the aviator
chuckled, &ldquo;that flying over your field. Had
two passengers, sort of hard lookers, but well-dressed.
Said they lived in Hillcrest. They
wanted to go over the ball game. Kept telling
me to circle down, down, down. Then they&rsquo;d
say, &lsquo;No! Not now! Up again!&rsquo; They repeated
that little trick three times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know?&rdquo; the young aviator stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; the aviator cleared his throat.
&ldquo;The third time we went down closer than I
like to. Then we flew away. Sort of queer,
I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo; He shot Johnny an enquiring look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they carrying anything?&rdquo; Johnny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No gun or anything like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. What do you think? Think
we operate a bombing plane or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not quite that.&rdquo; Johnny lapsed into
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer business!&rdquo; The aviator stared at him
hard. &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much I guess.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone did
not change. &ldquo;Only thought I might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; the aviator exclaimed. &ldquo;If you
think that&rsquo;s queer, listen to this one. A short
while back I took a long trip, thousand miles
or more. Flew it at night. Passenger told me
where to go and where to land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Place we landed was all light when we were
coming down. It went dark the minute we
landed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two men in uniform came rushing up. One
said, &lsquo;Say! Where do you think you are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better,&rsquo; one of them yelled.
&lsquo;This is a Federal prison. Move out of here
quick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better leave right away.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s what my fare said to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aviator paused for breath. Johnny was
staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! That&rsquo;s not all!&rdquo; The aviator waved
a hand. &ldquo;The lights came on, bright as day,
just long enough for me to taxi across the enclosure
and rise; then all went dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And listen!&rdquo; He paused once more. &ldquo;When
my fare left the plane, there was a man with
him, a slim, dark-faced man. He came from
that prison. I&rsquo;d swear to it! Can you beat
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a jail delivery.&rdquo; Johnny spoke
low. &ldquo;Should think you&rsquo;d be afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; the aviator settled back in his
chair, &ldquo;only the man who went with me that
night, my passenger, was one of the best
known and most highly respected citizens in
this part of the country. I was hired by him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Slim, dark-faced man,&rdquo; Johnny murmured
to himself, recalling the aviator&rsquo;s words as he
rode home a short time later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />&ldquo;WHO&rsquo;S AFRAID OF A CHINAMAN?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Next morning Johnny wandered over to
the <i>Sentinel</i> office. He wanted to thank
the editor for the fine publicity he had given
the game. More than this he always had enjoyed
a half hour in the box-like office of
C. K. Lovell, or &ldquo;old C. K.&rdquo; as the people of
the city had come to call him.</p>
<p>C. K. was something of a character. More
than six feet tall, a broad-shouldered, slouching
figure of a man, with masses of gray hair
and bushy eyebrows, slumped down in his
office chair, he resembled a shaggy St. Bernard
dog basking in the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;llo Johnny!&rdquo; he greeted. &ldquo;Fine game
yesterday. Sort of queer, though. Rather unusual
about that pitcher! And did you notice
that airplane? What did you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t got it made yet.&rdquo; Johnny dropped
into a chair. &ldquo;Tough about that pitcher
though. It must not happen again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he enthused. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that a
grand crowd! Boys owe you a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; the editor laughed
good-naturedly. &ldquo;Boys deserved it. Fine lot
of boys. Be a bigger crowd than ever next
week. What about that electric umpire? Think
it will work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call strikes and balls, and all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure will, C. K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dodge pop bottles too?&rdquo; C. K. laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Pop bottles would be bad for his eyes.
Got forty eyes, that umpire has.&rdquo; Johnny
laughed. &ldquo;Guess the crowd will go easy on
that, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Johnny went on as the editor
showed his interest by hitching up in his chair,
&ldquo;an electric eye is like a radio tube. When a
beam of light is sent to it from across a space
it stays just so until the light is shut off by
some object, say a baseball. Then it sets up a
howl. If you connect it with a phonograph
attachment, you can make it call out &lsquo;Foul
ball!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting if true,&rdquo; C.K. drawled. &ldquo;Sure
ought to draw a crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say Johnny!&rdquo; The editor leaned forward
to speak in a tone little more than a whisper.
&ldquo;Heard anything about Federal agents being
around town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Federal agents!&rdquo; Johnny stared. &ldquo;No.
What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re looking for a Chinaman,
a little fellow&mdash;name&rsquo;s Tao Sing, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tao Sing!&rdquo; Johnny started. A mental picture
of Tao Sing in the small room at the back
of the Chinese spice shop flashed into his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I knew them all,&rdquo; said C.K. &ldquo;This
must be a new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Federal agents want a Chinaman?
Who&rsquo;s afraid of a Chinaman?&rdquo; This
last slipped from Johnny&rsquo;s lips unbidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s afraid of a Chinaman!&rdquo; C.K. sat up
straight quite suddenly. &ldquo;Plenty of people
afraid of a Chinaman, Johnny. Plenty!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Chinaman looks dull and sleepy enough,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;So does a big old tom cat. But
let a dog come around the corner and see what
the cat does to him. A Chinaman&rsquo;s like that.
He&rsquo;ll go up like a rocket most any time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I worked down near Frisco&rsquo;s old Chinatown,
Johnny, years ago,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Got
to be sort of an amateur guide. Went with the
police when they raided Chinese gambling
joints and opium dens. Say! I can hear the
steel door bang yet when the first Chink gave
the warning. Bang! Bang! Bang! And sometimes
it wasn&rsquo;t a door that banged either.&rdquo;
His voice dropped. &ldquo;Johnny, things happened
there I wouldn&rsquo;t dare tell about&mdash;not even
now. And that was a long time ago, a long
time ago.&rdquo; C.K. settled back in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny got to his feet a trifle
unsteadily. &ldquo;Guess I better get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did hurry. He was afraid he might
tell what he knew about Tao Sing. He was
not ready to do that&mdash;not just yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But boy, oh boy!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Would
what I know about that little Chink make
front page stuff! First column in every city!&rdquo;
He could see it now: &ldquo;<span class="small">CHINAMAN INVENTS
THOUGHT-RECORDING CAMERA. NO MAN&rsquo;S
THOUGHTS HIS OWN</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was sorely tempted to release the story
at once. On sober thought, however, he decided
he was not ready to do that&mdash;not yet!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;re looking for Tao Sing, those
Federal agents,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Wonder why?
Wonder if the think-o-graphs and the thought-camera
have anything to do with that?&rdquo; He
recalled his visit to the Chinese Chamber of
Commerce, of the pictures he had taken of
Wung Lu&rsquo;s thoughts and how he had delivered
them to Tao Sing. The thought was disturbing.
&ldquo;Ought not to have been snooping
round gathering up another fellow&rsquo;s thoughts,
then peddling them to someone else,&rdquo; he
grumbled. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; ah yes, and yet&mdash;if he
had not done that he could not have had the
thought-camera for his own use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use it a lot more,&rdquo; he assured himself.
&ldquo;Find out all sorts of queer things for C.K.
He&rsquo;ll run them in his paper and make a scoop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would he return to the Chinese Chamber
of Commerce? Well, not right away. He
recalled what C.K. had said of things that had
happened in old Frisco&rsquo;s Chinatown, and a
chill ran up his spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow&rsquo;d think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No matter what he&rsquo;d think. Here was Goggles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Johnny!&rdquo; Goggles exclaimed.
&ldquo;I heard you found out about that airplane
that was over the ball field yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t find out much&mdash;just that a pilot
from over at the flying field took two men up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I knew. The pilot said they were
from Hillcrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were it should be easy to find them.
Not many new people in Hillcrest. Only about
half a dozen stop at the hotel. Rest live in
houses. I&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em. Give me time.&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo;
big eyes gleamed behind his thick glasses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
an amateur detective, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done a little of that myself,&rdquo; Johnny said
with a grin. &ldquo;Not in a small city, though.
Guess I&rsquo;ll leave that to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find &rsquo;em, Johnny.&rdquo; Goggles was away.</p>
<p>Johnny smiled as he watched him hurry
down the street. Goggles sure was an interesting
boy. He dug into everything just as a
gopher digs into the earth. Chemistry, electricity,
detective work, it was all the same to
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Little cities are surely interesting,&rdquo; was
Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment. &ldquo;In big cities everyone
tries to be just like everyone else. People
think alike, walk alike, dress the same,
everything. In a little city everyone is different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he brought himself up with a jerk.
There was the thought-camera. Somehow,
since talking to C.K. about the Chinese, he
found himself all but overcome with a desire
to hide the thought-camera in some very dark
and secret spot. In the end, after hurrying
home, he buried it deep among the clothes in
his trunk, locked the trunk, then hid the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;re after Tao Sing!&rdquo; he murmured
low. &ldquo;Wonder if they&rsquo;ll find him. And if they
do, I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; he did not finish that last
wonder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />CLUES FROM THE DUST</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In cases like this&mdash;&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; eyes bulged
behind his thick glasses. His beak-like
nose appeared to wrinkle and wriggle as a
rabbit&rsquo;s. &ldquo;In a case like this,&rdquo; he repeated,
&ldquo;one may learn a great deal from dust. Take
a vacuum cleaner now. It&rsquo;s queer. I&rsquo;ve helped
clean dozens of furnished houses and apartments
after the tenants were gone. Some of
them would scrub the place till it shone like a
new dollar. But the vacuum cleaner! What
do you think?&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Always half full
of dust!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yes!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Same here. A
good big lot of dust. I&rsquo;m prepared. See!&rdquo; He
drew a stout paper sack from his pocket. Unfastening
the cloth dust-bag from the vacuum
cleaner, he proceeded to empty its contents
into the paper sack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust?&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;What can you do
with dust?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wait,&rdquo; said Goggles, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can have your dust,&rdquo; Johnny
grumbled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see how that can help any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since his visit to the landing field, Johnny
had been more convinced than ever that the
presence of that airplane above Hillcrest baseball
grounds on that day when the mysterious
&ldquo;Prince&rdquo; had somehow been forced from the
mound, had meant something very strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to something, that&rsquo;s what they were!&rdquo;
he had told himself. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to find
out what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recalling Goggles&rsquo; suggestion regarding the
manner in which these men might be found,
he hunted him up on the following day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found out anything?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m going to,&rdquo; Goggles replied.
&ldquo;It should not be hard. They live here.
They&rsquo;re strangers in town. They&rsquo;d rent furnished
rooms. All we have to do is to check
up on rentals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had checked up and they had, they
believed, found the very place they were looking
for. The description of the two men who
had rented a small furnished bungalow tallied
with that of the men they sought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>There was only one hitch&mdash;the men had
checked out of the bungalow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; Johnny had mourned. &ldquo;I
hoped to catch up with them. It&rsquo;s not so much
what they&rsquo;ve done as what they may do. It&rsquo;s
my theory that they have a grudge of some
sort against the &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s got to pitch
some more games for us if we are to win.
Those men will do something more, perhaps
something a great deal worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do if we find them?&rdquo; Goggles
had asked. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proof is what we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can find clues in an empty house,&rdquo;
Goggles had declared. &ldquo;Plenty of them. It
doesn&rsquo;t matter that they&rsquo;re gone. Left all sorts
of clues behind. Take dust, for instance. You
get the keys and we&rsquo;ll go right over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here they were in the recently deserted
bungalow. Here was Goggles industriously
collecting dust while Johnny tiptoed softly
from room to room, pulling out drawers without
a sound and, after peering within, softly
closing them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust!&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;What good is a lot
of dust? You&rsquo;d think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>He broke off short to stare. In the drawer
just before him his eyes took in two objects.
One was a small dry battery of an unusual
shape. On the end of this was a threaded attachment
that apparently just fitted into the
small end of the other object. This second
object was a funnel-shaped tube a foot long.
It was an inch across at one end and three
inches at the other. The inside of this tube
shone with an unusual brilliancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer business!&rdquo; Johnny murmured. These
objects were quickly transferred to the inner
pocket of his coat. The drawer was softly
closed.</p>
<p>It would seem that he was not a second too
soon, for from below came the sound of an
opening door, then a gruff voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well son, you&rsquo;re cleanin&rsquo; the place up a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice sent a chill coursing up Johnny&rsquo;s
spine. It was the voice of a stranger. He was
talking to Goggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; answering voice sounded
unsteady and weak. &ldquo;I do this sort of
thing quite&mdash;quite a lot. Sort of&mdash;of dust up
a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well now that&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; (It did not sound
fine to Johnny.) &ldquo;But me and my pardners
here moved out of this place a short while
back. We came here to get a few things we
forgot, didn&rsquo;t we Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; a second gruff voice replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them shoes now,&rdquo; the first voice went on.
&ldquo;We left &rsquo;em. See you got &rsquo;em all cleaned up
for us.&rdquo; Goggles had found a pair of shoes
and had scraped the mud from them in search
of clues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; voice faded out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s O.K., buddy,&rdquo; said the first
voice again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just get on into the little
bedroom and look for a thing or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little bedroom.&rdquo; That was where
Johnny found himself at that instant. Like a
rabbit that has sighted a dog, he was up and
silently away. In truth he went out of the
side door to vanish into the shadows of a broad
old pine tree.</p>
<p>Well enough that he did too, for a moment
later he heard one of the strangers say to Goggles
in a tone not so friendly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! We left something in a dresser
drawer in that little bedroom. You cleaned in
there yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve not been out of this room.&rdquo;
Goggles stammered a little, but had spoken
the simple truth.</p>
<p>After looking him over from head to foot,
the speaker turned on his heel and left the
house. He was followed by his pardner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Goggles breathed five minutes
later, &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;think&mdash;. Come on!
Let&rsquo;s get out of here! I got &rsquo;em in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things they came back after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo; Goggles held out a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. I say, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Goggles agreed reluctantly.
&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve got all the dust I need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After locking the door, they hurried away
to Goggles&rsquo; basement where he had rigged up
a sort of laboratory and workshop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Goggles breathed, snapping on the
light, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have a look at that stuff from the
sweeper.&rdquo; He emptied the contents of the paper
sack into a sheet of wrapping paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now.&rdquo; With a needle set into the end of
an old pen-holder, he began dragging the stuff
about, at the same time naming his findings:
&ldquo;Hairs, dark ones, three or four of them. Their
hair is dark. That don&rsquo;t matter; but here&rsquo;s
some coarse sand they tracked in. Say! What
color is the stuff they have out on the landing
field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red sand,&rdquo; Johnny replied. &ldquo;Brought it in
trucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here it is, some of it!&rdquo; Goggles was
getting excited. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at this
other bag.&rdquo; He dumped coarse dirt on a second
paper. &ldquo;Came from the bottom of those
shoes,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Yes, there it is&mdash;red
sand, some oil mixed in&mdash;just what you&rsquo;d find
on a landing field. They&rsquo;re the men all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; Johnny replied
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do about it?&rdquo; Goggles
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing just now. You can&rsquo;t keep people
from flying over your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d think&mdash;Say!&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; tone
changed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sort of chemical in
this dust from the sweeper. Two kinds. One&rsquo;s
coarse and gray. Other&rsquo;s a fine white powder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He examined the contents of a small
envelope. &ldquo;Some of the white powder is in the
dust I took from the pocket of an old coat they
left. Must have rubbed it off his hands into
his pocket. People do that without thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goggles&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny found it hard to control
his voice, &ldquo;could you make a bright light
by touching off two powders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say you could! All kinds of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goggles&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was deeply serious,
&ldquo;you separate those chemicals from the
rest of the dust as well as you can, then keep
them&mdash;both kinds. It&mdash;it may be important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do more than that,&rdquo; Goggles agreed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them down to the laboratories. I&rsquo;ll
ask someone to test &rsquo;em out and tell me what
they are. Maybe I&rsquo;ll ask the &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo;?&rdquo; Johnny was surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talked to him twice. He isn&rsquo;t half bad,&rdquo;
admitted Goggles modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said he was? I think he&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;
Johnny put his cap on. &ldquo;All right. Got to get
going. See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in his own room, Johnny drew two objects
from his pocket and examined them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Then he closed his eyes. &ldquo;The eagle soared
and dropped,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;So did the airplane.
The eagle got a rabbit. The airplane
got a man. It was no accident that the
&lsquo;Prince&rsquo; had to give up pitching. I know why
he did&mdash;and&mdash;and I can almost prove it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two men,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;have it
in for the &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo; I wonder why? They&rsquo;ll do
something more. I wonder what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; he said stoutly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for
the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; a hundred percent!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />WHAT AN EYE!</h2>
<p>That evening Johnny sat on his grandfather&rsquo;s
porch staring at the moon and
allowing the events of the past few days to
glide across his memory as a panorama glides
across a picture screen.</p>
<p>It was strange! Here he was in the quiet
little city of his grandfather. He&rsquo;d been here
many times before. Nothing unusual had happened;
but now there was the little Chinaman
who apparently had been seen by no one but
himself and who was now being sought by
detectives. And there was the thought-camera.
He wondered whether the little man was still
in town, but had no desire to visit the spice
shop to find out for sure&mdash;at least not in the
dark. He recalled C. K.&rsquo;s words, and shuddered
afresh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo;&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;Queer sort of fellow. How did he come
here?&rdquo; He seemed to see an airplane landing
within prison walls. Had the Colonel rescued
him in that strange manner from a prison?
&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Perfectly
absurd!&rdquo; And yet, there was that air pilot&rsquo;s
story. &ldquo;Mystery wings!&rdquo; he whispered low.
How many mysterious things might be carried
on high in the air&mdash;kidnaping, smuggling,
daring robbers escaping from the scene of
their crime. What had happened that day as
the airplane soared over their baseball diamond?
He had a rather definite notion. But
was that idea correct? He meant to find out.</p>
<p>He thought of the coming ball game. The
&ldquo;Prince&rdquo; would be there. He had promised to
come. Meggy had brought word of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Meg!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;How I&rsquo;d
like to tell her about the thought-camera!&rdquo; He
was burning to tell someone. And yet, had he
the right? Meg would keep the secret.
Threats of death would not wring it from her.
Good old Meg! And yet&mdash;. He wouldn&rsquo;t tell,
not just now.</p>
<p>How was the ball game to come out? And
Goggles&rsquo; forty-eyed umpire? Would it work?
They would get a crowd, he was sure of that.
But would they be able to satisfy that crowd?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>He stole a glance at his grandfather. As
usual, he sat in his big chair dreaming of the
past. Slipping up the stairs, Johnny returned
with the thought-camera under his coat. He
recorded one more chapter of the grand old
man&rsquo;s life. Then he crept back upstairs again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how that thing works,&rdquo; he murmured
as he once more hid the camera in the
bottom of his trunk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a lot to know.&rdquo;
He had read of things scientists were doing
with what they called the spectrum, how they
divided it into different rays, red, violet, indigo
blue, and how some rays were life-giving
and some deadly. It might be something like
that. If he knew the secrets of that camera
he could become the richest person in the
world. Perhaps some day he would know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he laughed low, &ldquo;the next thing
is a ball game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was late to the Wednesday game. His
grandfather had a hurry-up call into the
country. Johnny drove the car. Twenty miles
from town they got a flat tire. The bolts stuck.
He was a full hour getting it changed. When
he finally reached the ball grounds the game
had been in progress for some time and, to his
great surprise and consternation, this is what
he heard:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! What an eye! Kill that umpire! Git
a pop bottle! Git twenty pop bottles! Wreck
him! Wreck him!&rdquo; The cries were loud and
persistent from every corner of the grandstand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is,&rdquo; Doug Danby groaned as Johnny
came racing up, &ldquo;they are liable to break
loose any minute and do just that&mdash;&lsquo;wreck the
umpire.&rsquo; And that umpire cost hundreds of
dollars. How could we ever pay it back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doug was, he believed, at that moment the
most miserable person in the world. They
were losing, losing the game they by all odds
should be winning. And it was all his fault,
or at least he accepted the blame. He, as captain
of the team, had stood up for Goggles&rsquo;
mechanical umpire. &ldquo;And now look!&rdquo; He
gave Johnny an appealing glance.</p>
<p>Johnny didn&rsquo;t want to look. Everyone else
was looking; that is, everyone on the Hillcrest
bleachers, and everyone was yelling:
&ldquo;Wide a mile!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Way below his knees!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Take out that umpire! Wreck him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Strike!
Strike! Strike!&rdquo; They began chanting this as
a refrain, and clapping their hands in a
rhythmic accompaniment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, something&rsquo;s gone terribly wrong!&rdquo;
Meggy Strawn screamed this into Johnny&rsquo;s
ear above the din.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling us!&rdquo; Doug shouted back.
&ldquo;Terribly wrong! I&rsquo;d say! Bill&rsquo;s out on strikes
and all three were balls. Dave&rsquo;s got two
strikes now, and there&mdash;no&mdash;that tin umpire
called it a ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Meggy jumped up and down.
&ldquo;Dave swatted it. It&rsquo;s a two bagger! Rah for
Dave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doug did not shout. He was glad Dave had
made second. But he was sure he&rsquo;d never see
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat a crooked umpire,&rdquo; he
groaned. That the umpire was crooked he
could not by this time doubt. Yet, how could
it be? A mechanical umpire with an eye a
thousand times faster than the human eye,
set to call balls and strikes impartially, all the
balls to be outside the plate, above the shoulder
or below the knee, a mere thing of electrical
tubes and cells, of wires and steel mechanisms,
how could that kind of an umpire be
crooked? Doug could find no answer. Nor
could Johnny. He could only stand and stare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; Meggy whispered, &ldquo;why does
that Fairfield sub always stand leaning against
that post while our team is up to bat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The post she spoke of stood before the bench
used by the visiting team. It held one end of
the wire cable that kept the crowd off the
field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably leans because he&rsquo;s the leaning
sort,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done that for four innings.&rdquo; Meggy&rsquo;s
tone was low, mysterious. Johnny missed that
tone. He was too much absorbed by what was
going on to notice it. &ldquo;When his team comes
up to bat,&rdquo; Meg went on, &ldquo;he goes back to the
bench. Then when we are at bat again, he
hops up, strolls slowly to the post and stands
there until the inning is over. Johnny, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; It was Doug who interrupted her.
&ldquo;Steve struck out. I&rsquo;m up. Watch me fan!
All I got to do is stand right still, and that
tin umpire will call &lsquo;Strike! Strike! Strike!&rsquo;
and I&rsquo;m out! You just watch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doug!&rdquo; Meggy gripped his arm tight.
&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re being almost yellow. Buck up!
Get in there and win in spite of odds. There&rsquo;s
something crooked about it. We all know
that. But we can&rsquo;t help it. At least not now.
Listen! Uncle Rob told me once he&rsquo;d seen a
lot of crooked things tried in all sorts of games,
but he&rsquo;d found out this&mdash;if the straight player
stood up to it and did his level best he&rsquo;d win;
but that a fellow who is crooked can never do
his best&mdash;his conscience won&rsquo;t let him. So you
just get in there and swat that ball! Strike at
every one. Boot it over the fence! And next
time, when you&rsquo;re up, I&rsquo;m going to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish. Doug was gone.</p>
<p>With Meggy&rsquo;s words ringing in his ears,
Doug marched up to the plate. Ten seconds
later he saw the ball coming. Figuring it would
be &ldquo;wide a mile,&rdquo; he gave a quick side-wise
lurch, swung the bat, struck the ball low and
hard, then dashed for first base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go! Go! Go! Go on!&rdquo; came in a deafening
roar. Nor did that call subside until he
had crossed the home plate. He had boosted
the ball clear out of the lot, a home run just
like that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But even that won&rsquo;t win,&rdquo; he told Johnny
gloomily. &ldquo;The score is still 5 to 3 in their
favor. And that tin umpire is set dead against
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conclusion seemed fair enough, for
when Tim Tyler, the best batter on their team,
came up next he went down &ldquo;One, two, three.&rdquo;
After that the Hillcrest players wandered
gloomily to their places on the diamond.</p>
<p>Doug played right field. Since the men on
the opposing team almost to a man batted
right handed, he now had plenty of time to
think. And those were long, long thoughts,
you may be sure. &ldquo;How could that electrical
umpire be crooked?&rdquo; he asked himself over and
over. &ldquo;It worked perfectly every time yesterday.
If it wasn&rsquo;t for the pledge that both teams
made to see the thing through, I&rsquo;d demand a
new umpire. But thunder! We&rsquo;d look fine
throwing out our own umpire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, they had tried the umpire out the day
before. Goggles had secured the necessary
equipment from the electrical shop which was
really a laboratory for research work, and with
the assistance of the head electrician had set
the electrical umpire in place on the ball
grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he had explained before they
started to test it out, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a battery of ten
lights shining out at the side beyond the
plates. There are ten above the batter&rsquo;s shoulder,
and ten below the knee. These lights shine
on electric eyes. The moment one of these
lights is shut off, even for an instant, a red
light will flash and a phonograph shout, &lsquo;Foul.&rsquo;
Two other batteries of lights watch for strikes.
Another phonograph calls &rsquo;em. Now you fellows
try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did try it. Tried it many times and
not once had the mechanical umpire failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did not slip once yesterday,&rdquo; Doug
groaned to himself out there on the field
watching for any chance fly that might come
his way. &ldquo;And now, today, when the Fairfield
batters are up, it works perfectly, but when
we are up it just squints its forty eyes and
gives the pitcher all the breaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crowds,&rdquo; the boy grumbled, &ldquo;are queer.
One minute they are with you, next they are
against you.&rdquo; It had been so with the crowd
from his own town in regard to the mechanical
umpire. When they had heard it call &ldquo;Strike!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Foul!&rdquo; then &ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; once more, they had
gone wild over it. &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he groaned,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re all against it. May swarm onto the
field any minute and smash it up. Worst is,&rdquo;
he grumbled on, &ldquo;we agreed to abide by the
decision of that brainless mechanical man&mdash;even
put it in writing. Both teams signed it&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. There had come a wild
shout from the enemy&rsquo;s bleachers. A high fly
came sailing his way. Judging it correctly, he
turned his back and ran; then, whirling about
just in time, put up a single hand to nab the
ball. It was a beautiful catch. Even the rivals
applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Great! Wonderful!&rdquo; His teammates
patted him on the back as they raced
in for their turn at bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot of good that will be,&rdquo; Doug grumbled.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re beat right now; beaten by our own
little tin umpire. What an eye! is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Meggy&rsquo;s words came back to him:
&ldquo;Go in and beat them anyway. Fellows that
are crooked seldom win. Their conscience
won&rsquo;t let them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo; He set his teeth tight. &ldquo;Win
in spite of it all. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>His thoughts broke short off. What was
Meggy up to now? She had walked away from
her regular place, had crossed the field and
was standing leaning against the white post
just before the bench used by the rival team&mdash;the
one she had said the Fairfield sub leaned
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;s gone over to the enemy,&rdquo;
Doug whispered to Johnny. She hadn&rsquo;t,
though. He knew Meggy better than that.
But what <i>was</i> she there for? Surely that was
a puzzler.</p>
<p>Shortly after the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; took up his batting
position for old Hillcrest, the sub from
the Fairfield bench moved forward to touch
Meggy on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Miss, you&rsquo;ll have to move. It&rsquo;s this
way. The boys back on the bench can&rsquo;t see
through you.&rdquo; His tone was apologetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Is that so?&rdquo; Meggy&rsquo;s pug nose turned
fully half an inch higher. &ldquo;Well then! Suppose
they try sliding along on the bench.&rdquo; She
held her position.</p>
<p>The sub returned to his bench discomfited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>In the meantime, wonder of wonders, the
electrical umpire of forty eyes had at last apparently
taken pity on the Hillcrest team and
was giving them a square deal. The &ldquo;Prince&rdquo;
actually got a base on balls.</p>
<p>The fans on the bleachers ceased their fruitless
razzing of the tin umpire and began to
cheer. The opposing pitcher appeared to be
losing his poise. After dealing out three more
balls, he tossed Dave Dawson an easy one and
Dave swatted it for a two bagger. Another
walk, and the bags were loaded.</p>
<p>Fairfield changed pitchers. The fresh pitcher
bore down hard. The result for that inning
was one score for Hillcrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on boys!&rdquo; Doug yelled. &ldquo;A shut-out
this time! Then we&rsquo;ll go after them. Two
more runs and we got &rsquo;em. Something&rsquo;s happened.
I don&rsquo;t know what, but at last we&rsquo;re
getting a square deal from our old tin ump.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>The shut-out was managed easily. The
&ldquo;Prince&rdquo; did his part nobly. Two pop-ups and
a strike-out did the work. All this time Doug
was like one in a trance. Strange things were
happening. The mechanical umpire had suddenly
gone on the square. But poor Meg! She
had apparently quite lost her mind. She was
still leaning on that white post before the enemy&rsquo;s
bench. Had anyone been close beside
her, however, he would have noticed that her
attention was divided between a certain spot
on the ground close to the post and a Fairfield
player who had remained on the bench. The
player was captain of the rival team. He had
sent the sub out to take his place.</p>
<p>Hardly had the batting begun than this captain
rose with some dignity to approach Meggy.
&ldquo;Sorry, dear child,&rdquo; his air was patronizing,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll have to leave. This is our side
of the diamond. Besides, you are in danger
of being struck by a foul ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Thank you!&rdquo; Meggy smiled sweetly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully good at ducking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>must</i> leave!&rdquo; The visiting captain&rsquo;s
tone was stern.</p>
<p>Meggy did not answer. Instead she turned
her back upon him to cup her hands and shout
across the diamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yoo-hoo! Johnny! Bring me that spade!
There&rsquo;s a dandelion, a great big one, here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonished Johnny did her bidding. The
rival captain held his ground. A look of dread
overspread his face. He seemed to be saying
to himself, &ldquo;What will this wild young creature
do next?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>He did not have long to wait. Seizing the
spade, Meggy hissed, &ldquo;There! Right down
there!&rdquo; then sank her spade deep.</p>
<p>The captain made a move as if to stop her,
opened his mouth as if to speak, then retired
in apparent confusion.</p>
<p>There was no dandelion where Meggy sank
her spade. The spot of gold that was a yellow
&ldquo;dannie&rdquo; was fully a yard away. She did not
trouble the dandelion at all. Instead, she sank
her spade with a vicious poke of her stout
young foot three times. Then, shouldering
her spade as if it were a rifle, she marched back
to her own bleachers and took up the task of
cheer leader. She led the Hillcrest team to
such a victory as the old town had never before
witnessed. When the ninth inning was
ended and Doug was borne in triumph off the
field, the score stood 22 to 7 in favor of the
home team. Doug, riding aloft on his fellow
townsmen&rsquo;s shoulders, was disturbed by a
vague feeling that Meggy was far more richly
deserving of this ride than he. But why? This
he could not tell. That was to come later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Meggy, you&rsquo;re holding something back,&rdquo;
Johnny insisted as he sat with Meg and Doug
on Meg&rsquo;s porch drinking lemonade late that
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Meg laughed, &ldquo;then I am. And
I suppose you&rsquo;d like to know what. They say,&rdquo;
she smiled whimsically, &ldquo;that &lsquo;figures won&rsquo;t
lie but liars will figure.&rsquo; Well, Goggles may
be able to make a perfect mechanical umpire,
but he can&rsquo;t keep some other electrical shark
from tampering with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo; she leaned forward, eyes gleaming,
&ldquo;you set up your equipment yesterday.
During the night some smart boy from Fairfield
came over and cut in a switch that would
turn half the eyes of old Mr. Umpire off when
they wanted them off. That gave Mr. Ump
only half sight. And of course they made him
half blind every time our team came up. He
couldn&rsquo;t see the balls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t under&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Peggy held up a hand. &ldquo;The switch
was by that white post. They&rsquo;d buried the
wires underground two or three inches. When
I saw that sub stand there every inning, I
guessed there was a reason. So&mdash;o, you see,&rdquo;
she laughed, &ldquo;I took his place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been throwing the switch off and on
with his toe. Couldn&rsquo;t while I was there. Bye
and bye I discovered the switch, figured out
where the wires ran, then chopped one off with
that spade. After that old Mr. Ump could see
very well all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meg!&rdquo; Doug exclaimed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a whizz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; Meg laughed.
&ldquo;One thing I do know. The score wouldn&rsquo;t
have been so terrible if they hadn&rsquo;t tried to
cheat. Which all goes to show that the fellow
that cheats can&rsquo;t win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo; Johnny laughed. &ldquo;Now how
about another lemonade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Doug sighed a happy sigh as he
rose to leave a half hour later, &ldquo;we got our
thousand dollars and a little left over. So the
old ball ground is safe, at least for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; gr&mdash;and today!&rdquo; Meg&rsquo;s
tone was rich and mellow. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he mysterious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure was good!&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;And
no one bothered him today. That airplane did
not come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will,&rdquo; a voice seemed to whisper in
his ear. &ldquo;You wait! Mystery wings!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />THE VANISHING CHINAMAN</h2>
<p>On his way home Johnny met Goggles.
&ldquo;Great work, Goggles!&rdquo; he exclaimed
with enthusiasm. &ldquo;That stunt of yours sure
drew a crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-a,&rdquo; Goggles said with a drawl. &ldquo;There
was a time, though, when it looked as if the
old ump and I&rsquo;d be mobbed. That Fairfield
bunch played a mean trick on us. Ought to be
thrown out of the League.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Johnny paused for
thought. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t prove a member of
their team did it. We licked &rsquo;em good and
plenty. That should be enough. Anyway, they
don&rsquo;t stand high in the League. Centralia&mdash;there&rsquo;s
the team we&rsquo;ve got to watch out for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; big eyes bulged. &ldquo;I think
Hop Horner and I have got a new pitcher for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new pitcher?&rdquo; Johnny stared. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter with the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Only&mdash;&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; voice dropped
to a low, mysterious note, &ldquo;this pitcher&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to go some if he&rsquo;s as different
as the &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised! Tell you what.&rdquo; The
young inventor&rsquo;s tone changed. &ldquo;You know
that open space out in the center of the pine
grove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet me there day after tomorrow about
two in the afternoon. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bring this&mdash;this
er&mdash;pitcher round. Let&mdash;well, sort of let him
throw over a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll be there. But I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;
Johnny looked up. Goggles was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s he up to!&rdquo; Johnny muttered
as he turned toward home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wander over to that Chink spice shop,&rdquo;
he told himself with sudden resolve. &ldquo;See if
Tao Sing&rsquo;s there.&rdquo; He felt in his pocket. Yes,
the latest think-o-graph of the wise Wung
Lu&rsquo;s thoughts was there. He would give it to
Tao Sing and then go right home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want Tao Sing?&rdquo; the clerk behind the
counter asked as Johnny entered the shop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can do.&rdquo; The Chinaman showed all his
yellow teeth in a broad grin. &ldquo;Tao Sing gone
velly fast, velly far, mebby not come back velly
quick.&rdquo; He laughed a dry mirthless laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s eyes swept the place nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll come back some other time.&rdquo;
As he slid out of the place Johnny barely escaped
bumping into two slim young men who
had an air of watchful waiting about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Federal agents, like as not,&rdquo; was the
thought that struck him all of a heap. Experience
had taught him that the best detectives
of today were likely to be young, slender
and quick. These were of that sort.</p>
<p>Finding himself still free, he hurried away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought to tell them,&rdquo; he thought.
And then, a moment later, &ldquo;Tell them what?&rdquo;
What, indeed? What did he know about Tao
Sing that Federal agents should know? Little
enough, that was certain. &ldquo;Know he wants to
salt down some of Wung Lu&rsquo;s wisdom,&rdquo; he
chuckled. Then of a sudden it occurred to him
that the sort of knowledge he had secured from
Wung Lu&rsquo;s thoughts might not be that which
wise men would record in a book of Chinese
philosophy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like to read just one of them,&rdquo; he told himself.
He fingered the small metal box in his
pocket. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning Johnny, Doug, and old Professor
George went to the bank and drew out
a thousand dollars. &ldquo;Whew! What a lot of
money!&rdquo; Doug whispered.</p>
<p>They carried it to Big Bill Tyson&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, William,&rdquo; Professor George
squeaked in his high-pitched voice. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
your first payment on the baseball grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Fine!&rdquo; Big Bill&rsquo;s eyes shone as if
he were truly glad. And perhaps he was. Big
Bill loved money. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the contracts you&rsquo;ll
have to sign.&rdquo; He wheeled about in his swivel
chair. &ldquo;One for you and one for me. Don&rsquo;t
mind signin&rsquo; with them, do you Professor?
Mere matter of form. Boys are under age, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll sign the contracts, William.&rdquo; The
aged professor&rsquo;s smile was a fine thing to see.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always glad to help the boys out. And
William, I&rsquo;m proud to see that you&rsquo;re willing
to do your part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Big Bill&rsquo;s eyes squinted in a strange way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes!&rdquo; His voice seemed unusually
loud and a trifle off key like the dong of a
cracked bell. &ldquo;Yes, Professor, you and I must
help the boys out when we can. Here&mdash;you
sign right there, all three of you. And then
this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up when all had signed. &ldquo;Well
boys, I wish you luck.&rdquo; Just then, strangely
enough, a cloud passed over the sun. It left
Big Bill&rsquo;s face in a shadow that to Johnny&rsquo;s
keen imagination seemed a mask. A moment
later they were out in the open air and the sun
had escaped from behind the cloud.</p>
<p>That evening Johnny got out the two
strange objects he had taken from the deserted
bungalow&mdash;the battery and the bright tube.
He studied them a long time, screwing them
together and unscrewing them many times.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Those
were the men who flew over the ball field, I am
sure of that. They had these. Wonder if Goggles
still has those two powders. Hope he
has.&rdquo; With that he hid the battery and tube
along with the thought-camera at the bottom
of his trunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Johnny! Come in here a minute.&rdquo; It
was old C.K. the editor who called to Johnny
from his door next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just thought I&rsquo;d tell you,&rdquo; C.K. said as
Johnny took a seat in his office, &ldquo;that, mebby
you didn&rsquo;t know it, but Big Bill Tyson drove
a sharp bargain with you boys and old Professor
George yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a sharp bargain!&rdquo; Johnny stared. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t pay too much did we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no. The price is a fair one,&rdquo; C.K.
drawled. &ldquo;But!&rdquo; He sat straight up. &ldquo;How
you boys going to raise four thousand dollars
in sixty days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four thou&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the contract you signed. Doug
showed it to me yesterday. Didn&rsquo;t say anything
to him about it. Wanted to think it
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;&rdquo; he sank back in his chair,
&ldquo;you boys can&rsquo;t be held for it, but the contract
is binding. Four thousand dollars in sixty
days, five thousand more in three years&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the way it reads. And, as it stands Professor
George is stuck for it. He signed you know.
He&rsquo;s got a little house and a few investments.
I figure it will about clean him out. Tough,
I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why! I&mdash;it can&rsquo;t happen!&rdquo; Johnny exploded.
&ldquo;Big Bill tricked us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; C.K. agreed. &ldquo;Too bad!
But a contract is a contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four thousand dollars!&rdquo; Doug groaned
when Johnny told him of it. &ldquo;And to think
good old Professor George will have to suffer
for our blunder! Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t suspect
Big Bill. Professor George is so honest
and kind himself, he&rsquo;d never suspect a trick.
Johnny, we&rsquo;ve just got to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we have,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;But just
think! Four thousand in sixty days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four thousand. Sixty days,&rdquo; Doug repeated
after him. This was followed by a vast
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />SECRET OF THE PINES</h2>
<p>Next day, in keeping with his promise to
Goggles, Johnny found himself seated
beneath the broad-spreading boughs of a pine
tree. All about him were other pines. He was
not in a forest, but a grove&mdash;a twenty acre
grove of pines. Old Colonel Pinchot had
planted them there a half century ago. Now
they were known simply as The Pines. The
heart of The Pines was a marvelous place to
think, and Johnny was thinking hard. When
he went into anything he went in heart and
soul, did Johnny. He had gone in for the Hillcrest
baseball team for all he was worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;looks as if it were
all off just because&mdash;well, because somebody
wants what he wants and appears to have the
power to take it. Four thousand dollars!&rdquo; He
gave vent to a low grunt. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s a fellow to
raise that much in times like these, for a baseball
team,&mdash;and in sixty days! It can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>He broke short off to listen. A curious
sound, for such a place, had struck his ear.
It seemed to be the low rattle and chuck-chuck
of a two wheel cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that be carting things about way
out here?&rdquo; he asked himself. The question soon
ceased to interest him. His mind turned once
more to strange happenings in old Hillcrest.
The little Chinaman with his thought-camera
and think-o-graphs, lurking Federal agents,
the mysterious pitcher, and Big Bill Tyson&mdash;all
came in for their share of his thoughts. He
lingered longer on the question of Big Bill and
the four thousand dollars than all the rest, but
was no nearer a solution than before, when to
his vast surprise he saw Goggles break
through the pine boughs, dragging a heavy
cart behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; the young inventor exclaimed,
mopping his brow. &ldquo;That thing pulls like a
ton of bricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why pull it?&rdquo; Johnny grinned.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your friend the pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right in behind.&rdquo; Goggles grinned broadly
as he nodded at something covered with
canvas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a hand,&rdquo; Goggles grumbled. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&mdash;I
mean he&rsquo;s pretty heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonished Johnny saw him throw back
the canvas to disclose several sections of a
mechanical contraption that might have been
just anything at all.</p>
<p>His astonishment was not very much abated
when, some fifteen minutes later, he saw
standing before him on an improvised pitcher&rsquo;s
mound a six-foot figure that to some degree
resembled a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet Irons O.&rdquo; Goggles beamed. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t walk very well. He&rsquo;s quite stiff-legged.
He&rsquo;s quite deaf, so there&rsquo;s no use talking to
him. But he can bawl out the umpire something
fierce. His eyesight is very bad, so someone
has to catch the ball for him and throw
bases. But boy! How he can pitch! With just
a little training he could fan out Babe Ruth
nine times out of ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he said, handing Johnny a big baseball
mit, &ldquo;You just get down there about
where the catcher would stand, and I&rsquo;ll have
him throw a few over to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>After placing a ball between four steel fingers
and a cast iron thumb, Goggles touched
a button and the thing began a low puff-puff-puff
that resembled low, heavy breathing.
Johnny was mystified and amused beyond belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch this curve!&rdquo; Goggles shouted a moment
later. He touched a button. A steel arm
rose in air, wound up for all the world like a
professional pitcher, then let fly. The ball shot
forward, took a sudden broad curve, then
went thud against Johnny&rsquo;s big mit. A second
ball, then a third followed and all took that
same sharp curve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You set the fingers,&rdquo; Goggles explained in
a matter-of-fact voice. &ldquo;Look at this straight,
fast one.&rdquo; Once again the steel arm went
through its motion. This time the ball, shooting
straight ahead like a cannon ball, cut the
plate squarely in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny solemnly, &ldquo;is the
strangest thing I ever saw. A mechanical
pitcher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing less!&rdquo; Goggles agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whe&mdash;where&rsquo;d you get him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hop Horner and I have been working on
him down at the electric shop for months. You
see there&rsquo;s a little motor inside that generates
electricity. Electricity runs him. All a
fellow has to do is to set his fingers and operate
the controls. As I said before, he can even
rave at the umpire. Watch!&rdquo; He punched
two buttons and old Irons O began bobbing
his outlandish head. His steel teeth cracked
together again and again, while from his metal
throat there came sounds resembling the complaints
of a wildcat chased up a tree. &ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s
almost perfect!&rdquo; Goggles admitted proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, &ldquo;but what good is
he? You can&rsquo;t expect another ball team to let
you substitute a&mdash;a machine for a real flesh-and-blood
pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Goggles agreed,
&ldquo;but you can do this&mdash;it came to me just last
night. You can announce an exhibition game.
Get Centralia to come over and play us just
for fun&mdash;fun and profit. We&rsquo;d have a complete
sell-out. Can&rsquo;t you see it? Big headlines:
&lsquo;Come and See Irons O, the Mechanical Pitcher,
Perform!&rsquo; Why even Big Bill would have
to come and see that game! That game would
bring in the first hundred dollars or so toward
that four thousand.&rdquo; Goggles went hopping
about in his excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good to me,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<p>And indeed it sounded good to everyone interested
in the Hillcrest baseball team. The
date of the game was set for the following
Saturday. As Goggles had predicted, the
thing became a headline story. Reporters were
admitted to the evergreen grove for a demonstration.
Everyone else was barred. Then
Irons O went into seclusion; a seclusion however
that was to prove not quite adequate for
the occasion.</p>
<p>When the time came for calling the game
every bleacher seat and all available standing
space was packed. The fame of the mechanical
pitcher was spread far and wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the bag,&rdquo; Johnny grinned broadly
as he saw old Professor George tucking the
day&rsquo;s receipts, a fat wad of bills, into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Goggles warned. &ldquo;Remember, we
promised a perfect performance. &lsquo;Nine full innings
pitched by Irons O, or your money
back.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the way the handbills were printed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>For all this the young inventor wore a jaunty
air as he marched out to the pitcher&rsquo;s mound
where his mechanical man awaited him.</p>
<p>Touching a button here, another there, he
caused Irons O to bob his head from side to
side, then let out a cry of defiance at the shouting
throng. The crowd roared back its glee.</p>
<p>When this roar had subsided another
reached Johnny&rsquo;s ear. A huge bi-motored
plane was circling to the landing field a half
mile away. A shudder ran over him. He had
not forgotten those &ldquo;Mystery wings,&rdquo; nor the
two strangers who had done something terrible
to the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; on that other day. &ldquo;Have
trouble doing it to a mechanical pitcher.&rdquo; He
laughed in spite of himself.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, as the players took their
place on the field, Johnny saw three men in
aviation caps crowding toward the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who they are and what they
want?&rdquo; he thought to himself. Something
seemed to tell him that their arrival was important.
Why? He could not tell.</p>
<p>The great moment came at last, and &ldquo;Irons
O pitching!&rdquo; the megaphone announced at the
end of the line-up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Goggles&rsquo; fingers trembled as he threw on an
electric switch, then pressed the button. And
well they might tremble for Irons O, instead of
facing the batter and doing his plain duty, let
out a defiant squeal, turned half about, wound
up and let fly at the astonished second baseman
who, taken off his guard, was struck
squarely on the chest and knocked over like a
policeman with a bullet through his heart. Instantly
pandemonium broke loose. Goggles
could not hear himself think for the wild tumultuous
noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />THE STEEL-FINGERED PITCHER</h2>
<p>Next moment Goggles found himself experiencing
one of the tragic moments of
his young life. In a moment of confidence and
enthusiasm he had agreed to direct his mechanical
man, Irons O, while he pitched a nine
inning game of baseball, and now before a
crowd of three thousand or more, old Irons O,
who had always been reliable in the past, had
turned squarely about on the first pitch and
had all but sent the second baseman to the
hospital with a baseball in his heart. What
was the answer?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been fooling with him,&rdquo; Hop
Horner shouted as he came running up.
&ldquo;Here! Give me the screw driver. That&rsquo;s it.
Now the wrench.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time out!&rdquo; a big voice roared, &ldquo;Time out!&rdquo;
It was Big Bill Tyson. Everyone roared with
delight; that is, everyone but those who were
interested in the youthful inventor&rsquo;s success.
Good old Professor George did not laugh. Instead,
he crowded forward to ask, &ldquo;Anything
I can do here boys? Anything at all?&rdquo; As if
a professor who had taught Latin all his life
could do anything with a mechanical man!
All the same it made Goggles feel good inside.
A friend at a time like this&mdash;well that was
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wires all twisted up,&rdquo; Hop was grumbling.
&ldquo;Somebody messed &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For fifteen minutes the two boys worked
feverishly. Perspiration streamed down their
faces. Their hands were black and oily, their
knees trembling. &ldquo;Hundreds of dollars gone,&rdquo;
Goggles was thinking, &ldquo;hundreds gone if we
fail. Hope for the baseball park gone perhaps.&rdquo;
Still Irons O would not swing his arms in a
proper manner.</p>
<p>The crowd was getting out of hand. Some
were swarming on the field. In one corner,
led by a small dark man, a group was chanting
in a maddening manner: &ldquo;We want baseball!
We want baseball! We want Irons O! We
want Irons!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>It was in the midst of this uproar that Goggles
felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to
find himself looking into the friendly smiling
face of a man wearing an aviator&rsquo;s helmet.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of those men from the big plane,&rdquo;
he thought to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; the stranger was saying, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
that wire, the short one with a pink thread in
its insulation&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it out of place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Sure it is!&rdquo; Goggles felt his thoughts
clearing. Seizing a pair of pliers, he quickly
made the change. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;Now!
Let&rsquo;s try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did try it and old Irons O did his work
perfectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. boys?&rdquo; the stranger asked, still smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.!&rdquo; Goggles breathed.</p>
<p>Seizing a megaphone, the man roared, &ldquo;Ready
to go! Clear the field!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the crowd settled into its place.
A look of pleasant anticipation flashed like a
gleam of sunlight from face to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-strike!&rdquo; the umpire roared. The game
was on. And such a game as it proved to be!
A plucky, good-natured young fellow cheerfully
pitted his strength and skill against a
thing made of iron, copper and steel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>The first Centralia batter went down, one,
two, three in a row. Goggles, with Irons O&rsquo;s
aid, had given him two easy curves and a
straight swift one. Perhaps the batter experienced
stage fright at batting against such a
pitcher. However that might be, he went
down swinging and the crowd roared its applause.</p>
<p>The second batter came to bat wearing a
confident grin. Nor did his confidence go unrewarded.
He made first on a line drive and
received his full share of fans&rsquo; approval.</p>
<p>Then Irons O appeared to lose his control.
He gave the third batter three balls in a row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid of him! He&rsquo;s walking him.
Boo! Boo!&rdquo; came in good-natured banter.
&ldquo;Boo! Boo! Boo!&rdquo; shouted the crowd. Whereupon
Irons O, dropping his steel arm to his
side, turned his head half around and, to the
umpire&rsquo;s surprise, let out wildcat howls that
could be heard at the farthest end of the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that umpire!&rdquo; someone shouted.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that pop bottle?&rdquo; But it was all in
fun. The mechanical pitcher tightened up,
pitched three sizzlers in a row. A moment
later, a third man went out on a pop-up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Johnny Thompson saw all of this inning.
He saw very little of those that followed. In
all that throng he was interested in just one
man&mdash;the little dark fellow who had led the
razzing when Irons O appeared to be down
and out for good. Johnny had always been
interested in the things people did and their
reasons for doing them. This little dark man
was a complete stranger to him. He wondered,
at first in a vague sort of way, why he
was such an ardent heckler. When Irons O
had been put into service again, he thought
he detected on the fellow&rsquo;s face a look of disappointment
and chagrin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can he care?&rdquo; Johnny asked himself.</p>
<p>All through the game he sat close to that
man and watched him. He had once seen two
large dogs fighting a battle for a bone. One
had dropped the bone. It lay beneath their feet
as they fought. A third dog, a sort of insignificant
hungry-looking pug, had hovered near
all during the fight, licking his chops but never
quite daring to seize the bone. Somehow, in
a strange sort of way, the expression on this
little man&rsquo;s face resembled that on the insignificant
pug&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what his interest in this game
can be!&rdquo; the boy whispered. &ldquo;I do wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Goggles, during his spare moments
while his team-mates were at bat, he was wondering
about an entirely different matter. The
men from the big airplane had caught his attention
at once. When one of them, evidently
a skilled mechanic, had interested himself in
their problem and aided them in solving it, he
had completely won Goggles&rsquo; heart. But Goggles&rsquo;
interest went farther than that. &ldquo;They
came here to see this game. Probably came
all the way from the big city, three hundred
miles away,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo;
For the time he could form no satisfying answer.</p>
<p>In the meantime the game went on. Bernard
caught the ball as it came back from the
catcher. He caught a pop-up fly now and then
and also threw bases. To the excitement of
the throng, Irons O did the rest. He pitched
a good game too, but no better than the smiling
pitcher from Centralia. Goggles had always
admired that Centralia pitcher, but never
as now. Now, as he directed the pitching
of Irons O, as the score went from 3 to 4, to
6-5; then from 7-8 to 8-10, his sympathies were
evenly balanced between the man of iron and
the man of brawn. Who was to win? Well
enough he knew that in the end it was up to
him to decide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>And so it turned out to be. At the end of
the first half of the ninth inning the score
stood 10-9 in the iron man&rsquo;s favor. At the beginning
of the game they had tossed up to see
who came first to bat. Centralia had lost, so
now in the last half of the ninth they were up
to bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to Irons O,&rdquo; Goggles breathed to
Johnny as he went out on the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means it&rsquo;s up to you!&rdquo; Johnny
smiled. He had read the story of struggle
written on the other boy&rsquo;s face. He wanted
his team and his iron man to win the game;
yet, down deep in his heart he had a feeling
that to set Irons O for a shut-out would be
taking an unfair advantage of that smiling
pitcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to give them a break,&rdquo; he murmured
as he took his place behind the man of
iron. He set Irons O&rsquo;s fingers for an easy
curve, then pressed the button.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;St-trike! Ball! St-trike! Ball! Ball.&rdquo; The
audience was on its toes. &ldquo;Ball three! Strike
two!&rdquo; Irons twisted his head about and
screamed at the umpire. Once again the audience
went into near-hysterics.</p>
<p>Goggles set the fingers for a swift fast one.
The man went down swinging.</p>
<p>Second batter up. Two curves went wild.
A swift fast one would have cut the plate in
halves had not a stout hickory bat sent it
shooting away into centerfield for a two bagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tying run on second and only one out!&rdquo;
Goggles was thinking hard. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have
it, not yet!&rdquo; he decided. He raised the speed
of the iron pitcher&rsquo;s arm a couple of notches,
then set his fingers for a very wide curve. A
ball and three strikes. The third batter went
down swinging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pitcher&rsquo;s up next. They&rsquo;ll put in a pinch-hitter,&rdquo;
Goggles thought. But no, here came
that smiling pitcher. He was swinging three
bats and smiling broader than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sure thing,&rdquo; the young inventor
groaned. &ldquo;But how can I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Mechanically he set the controls, gave the
ball into the iron pitcher&rsquo;s fingers, then whispered,
&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &ldquo;now&rdquo; was right. The ball, a slow
straight one, was met squarely by the strongly
swung bat. It rose high to go sailing away
over the bleachers and out of the park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home run, and the game&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; a thousand
voices shouted. A wild roar of approval
greeted the end of the game. Only the little
dark man, who had occupied so much of Johnny&rsquo;s
attention, did not cheer. He sat in moody
silence. &ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo; Johnny murmured.
Then he joined the throng that pressed on
toward the spot where the mechanical pitcher
stood.</p>
<p>A double rope barrier had been thrown
about Goggles, Hop Horner and their strange
invention. As for Irons O, he now bowed to
the grown-ups who cheered him, and then
screamed at the boys who shouted at him.
Take it all in all, it had been a day of complete
triumph for the Hillcrest boys and their iron
pitcher. And the day was not over&mdash;far from
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>The crowd had thinned to a mere handful
of over-curious boys, and Goggles was reaching
for a wrench and pliers for unhooking and
unscrewing his good iron friend when, as once
before that day, a friendly hand touched his
shoulder and smiling eyes met his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; the stranger said simply. It was
the man of the airplane. With him were his
two companions. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he began to explain,
&ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t just <i>happen</i> to come here. We
were sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guessed that.&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; heart leaped,
though he scarcely knew why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; The other seemed surprised.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;this is the story. Mr.
Montgomery here, who is vice-president of the
Northern Airways, read of this&mdash;this mechanical
man of yours. He wanted to see it perform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo; Goggles repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it.&rdquo; Montgomery, who appeared a
quick nervous type of man, stepped forward.
&ldquo;We are anxious to advertise air travel in every
way we can. We feel it to be safe and we
know it&rsquo;s a fast and clean way to travel. I
said to the boys: &lsquo;If that iron pitcher really
works, we&rsquo;ll pick him up with his whole ball
team and carry him across the country in one
of our big bi-motors, putting on exhibition
games.&rsquo; This&mdash;this man of yours&mdash;what is it
you call him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Irons O.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he put on a good show&mdash;a very fine
show. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; head was whirling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you in two hours, if&mdash;if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Meet us at the airport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Hop!&rdquo; Goggles threw his tools on
the ground as the man walked away. &ldquo;You
take old Irons O and put him to bed. I&rsquo;ve got
business, plenty of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say you have,&rdquo; Hop agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across the continent!&rdquo; Goggles thought as
he dashed wildly away. &ldquo;Across the continent
in an airplane. Ball games perhaps in Denver,
Cheyenne, Salt Lake City, Seattle! Boy! Oh
boy! And a bag of gold from every port for
our ball field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But could they do it? His spirits dropped.
&ldquo;Can we? It&mdash;it seems almost impossible. And
yet, somehow, we must. We just must!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goggles,&rdquo; Johnny said to him later that
evening when everything had been settled that
they were to start on that marvelous airplane
cruise. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the actions of that little
dark man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What little dark man?&rdquo; Goggles asked in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you notice him? But of course you
wouldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; Johnny went on to tell of the
little man&rsquo;s part in that day&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange that old Irons O should have
gotten all mixed up inside.&rdquo; Goggles said this
as if it were part of the story Johnny had just
finished. &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;if that
little dark man wants to make us trouble on
our trip, he&rsquo;ll have to hire a plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never do that,&rdquo; Johnny replied. To
his own surprise he found himself wondering,
&ldquo;What <i>will</i> he do?&rdquo; Had he known the answer,
he would have experienced an even
greater feeling of surprise.</p>

<br />THE WHITE FLARE</h2>
<p>To the members of the Hillcrest ball team
the days that followed were those of tremendous
thrills and heart breaking disappointment.
Whenever two members of the team
met, wildly enthusiastic words regarding the
coming airplane tour were exchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bi-motored plane!&rdquo; one would exclaim,
&ldquo;a great silver ship of the air. Hundred
and sixty miles an hour. And with a stiff
wind behind you, boy, oh boy! What a ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the way to the Pacific coast!&rdquo; the
other would fairly shout.</p>
<p>On the other hand two games were played.
Sad, tragic games they were indeed. Games
that counted in the pennant race, they were
lost. The &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; failed them. He did not
show up. Everyone asked &ldquo;Why? Why?&rdquo;
No one knew where he was; at least, if Colonel
Chamberlain knew he did not tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Fred Frame&rsquo;s arm gave out in the first of
the two games. Leander Larson, who took his
place, did his best. That best was not good
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a whole game behind Centralia!&rdquo;
Doug Danby groaned. &ldquo;Got one game with
her next week. If the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; don&rsquo;t show up
we&rsquo;ll lose, and that ends it all. What&rsquo;s the
good of a cruise with a steel-fingered pitcher,
after we&rsquo;ve lost the year&rsquo;s contest at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to think of the money you&rsquo;ll
make,&rdquo; Johnny reminded him. &ldquo;Taking that
cruise is the only thing that will save the ball
field to the boys of Hillcrest. And that&rsquo;s important.
That will last for years and years
and years. Why,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s like setting
up a monument to the team that&rsquo;s playing just
now! Better than a monument, I&rsquo;d say! A lot
better. You can only look at a monument. A
ball field you can enjoy using. Thousands will
have a good time there every year. It&rsquo;s your
grand and glorious opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;you&rsquo;?&rdquo; Doug demanded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going along, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny said soberly. &ldquo;Grandfather
has some government work to do, looking
after the loaning of money. I&rsquo;ve got to
drive for him. Anyway, I&rsquo;m not needed. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>He did not finish. He was about to say, &ldquo;Besides,
there&rsquo;s that missing Chinaman, Tao
Sing, the Federal agents, and the thought-camera.
I&rsquo;ve got to see that thing through.&rdquo;
He did not say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides what?&rdquo; Doug asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing,&rdquo; Johnny countered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
be with you, that&rsquo;s all. Goggles and his mechanical
pal will have to go along. Those,
with the team, will give the airplane a pretty
good load.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Meggy,&rdquo; Johnny said that same afternoon,
&ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; come today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Meggy whispered, &ldquo;is just what I
asked Uncle Rob. And do you know what he
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said,&rdquo; Meggy whispered, &ldquo;the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo;
is afraid! Afraid of what, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I know,&rdquo; Johnny said slowly.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not quite sure. Sup&mdash;supposing I
don&rsquo;t answer until I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that&rsquo;s all right, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Meggy!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed, &ldquo;Do you
suppose you could get your uncle to let us go
down to see&mdash;see the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; and take Goggles
along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I could, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You try, then phone me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock that evening three dark figures
approached a door in the laboratories.
Through the clouded glass of that door a pale
light shone.</p>
<p>The smaller of the three, a boy, rapped three
times. The door opened a crack. Shining eyes
peered into the darkness. The door opened
wider. The trio entered. Meggy, Johnny and
Goggles found themselves being ushered into
a dimly lighted room. The room was lined on
all sides by test-tubes, beakers, retorts and all
manner of instruments that belong to the fascinating
and mysterious science of chemistry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted to see me?&rdquo; Something very
like a smile played about the lips of the
&ldquo;Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;er&mdash;it&rsquo;s this.&rdquo; Goggles drew two
very small bottles from his pocket, then held
them up to the light. Each vial contained a
small quantity of some chemical substance.</p>
<p>Taking these, the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; poured a little
from each upon a bit of tissue paper. He
pinched each, examined it under a pocket microscope,
poked it about with a needle. Then
straightening up, he said rather sharply,
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jus&mdash;just now I&rsquo;d rather not tell,&rdquo; Goggles
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The chemist&rsquo;s tone was
brusque. &ldquo;Want me to show you something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, he left the
room, returning in a moment with a rather
curious triangle of metal set on a wooden handle.
He scattered grains of two mysterious
powders along the bottom of this triangular
trough. Next he ran insulated wires with
bared ends, one each from two directions along
this trough. The ends almost, but did not
quite, touch. He connected the other ends of
these wires to a dry battery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he breathed. Methodically he fastened
a pair of very dark glasses before his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;watch for a surprise!
No harm. Just a bit of a shock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Too much thrilled to watch his next move,
the children jumped almost to the ceiling when
there came a dazzling white flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that from those few powders!&rdquo; Johnny
exclaimed. &ldquo;And no smoke at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; said quietly. &ldquo;A truly
marvelous discovery. By adding more powder
one may light up a square mile in the darkest
night&mdash;a great boon to aviators. With such
a powder at hand, no secret army movement
at night in war time could be sure to succeed.
A truly marvelous discovery!&rdquo; he repeated.
He did not say, &ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he knows,&rdquo; Johnny told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll pitch for us next Saturday?&rdquo;
There was pleading in Meggy&rsquo;s tone.
&ldquo;We need you badly. You&mdash;you just <i>can&rsquo;t</i> fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow passed over the strange dark face.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try to be there,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; replied.
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;I must bid you
goodnight. I am working on something for
the Colonel, some&mdash;something rather large for
so unimportant a person as myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo;&rdquo; Meggy made for the
door. &ldquo;Thank, oh thank you,&rdquo; came from the
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Johnny was the last one out. Just why he
should have looked back at the instant the door
was swinging shut behind him, he could never
tell. Enough that he did look back and that,
from this looking through a crack not more
than two inches wide, he received the shock
of his young life.</p>
<p>He saw a leg, the leg of the &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo; His
sock had slipped down. He was pulling it up.
In doing so, he lifted his trouser leg so high
that it showed his bared leg. <i>And that leg was
not brown, but white as Johnny&rsquo;s own.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not naturally brown!&rdquo; The thought
shot through the boy&rsquo;s mind like a flash. &ldquo;His
hands, arms and face are dyed; probably his
hair is too. I wonder why?&rdquo; He was to continue
wondering for some time to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />A TENSE MOMENT</h2>
<p>When a mysterious stranger takes up
his abode in any community, there is
sure to be a difference of opinion regarding
his true nature. To some he is certain to be a
romantic figure, to others an evil menace. It
was so with the &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo; There were those
who said he was a famous young chemist
working out a formula that was to be of vast
benefit to all the world. There were others&mdash;and
this was strange&mdash;many others who said,
&ldquo;He is an industrial spy! Colonel Chamberlain
will find this out too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what is an industrial spy? Probably
there was not one person in ten who could have
told. And always the thing we do not understand
is the one we fear most.</p>
<p>Having heard all this, Johnny, on the day
following his visit to the &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; buckled up
his courage and walked into Colonel Chamberlain&rsquo;s
office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Johnny!&rdquo; the Colonel greeted him.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s troubling you? Lost last week&rsquo;s
game? Well, you can&rsquo;t win &rsquo;em all. You&rsquo;ll
win next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure will,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny was sitting on the edge
of his chair. &ldquo;Colonel Chamberlain, what is an
industrial spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An industrial spy?&rdquo; The Colonel sat up.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man paid by one nation to steal industrial
secrets from another nation&mdash;new inventions,
new processes, new chemical inventions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added quickly, &ldquo;if you think our
J., the one you call &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; is an industrial spy,
think again. He&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo; Johnny settled back in his
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here!&rdquo; He was on his feet now.
&ldquo;Look at this, and this, and this.&rdquo; He was
dragging things from a paper bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; The Colonel smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell&mdash;tell you all about it.&rdquo; Johnny
seemed out of breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>When he got going, however, the things he
said, the proof he gave for all the things he
believed, left the good Colonel staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all you say is true&mdash;and of course it is&mdash;&rdquo;
the Colonel said slowly, &ldquo;something should be
done about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went into a brown study. He drummed
the desk with his pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;Rome was
not built in a day. Let&rsquo;s not be in a hurry. The
evidence you already possess convinces you
and me. But would it convince everyone?
We&rsquo;ll just wait a bit and see if we cannot gather
more. If those two men return they will
do something else. We&rsquo;ll be prepared to trap
them. Let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t worry along until
two weeks from&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;&rdquo; he consulted his
calendar. &ldquo;Yes sir! That&rsquo;s the very day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny knew he was speaking now of something
strange and quite unknown to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo; the Colonel repeated, &ldquo;You see if
we can&rsquo;t wait to spring this thing two weeks
from next Saturday, after the game, the last of
the season. And Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; he leaned forward
to whisper in the boy&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;I think at that
time I can tell you J.&rsquo;s secret. Or&mdash;wait! Better
still&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have him tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny in a tone that carried
conviction, &ldquo;will be swell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later he found himself once more
in the street. His precious paper bag of &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;
was securely tucked under his arm.</p>
<p>After taking a dozen steps he paused to look
back. Strangely enough, in his mind&rsquo;s eye he
saw at that moment not a brick building, but
an airplane landing. From the airplane two
persons stepped. One slim and dark with a
dyed face, and the other was Colonel Chamberlain.
Then his own words to the aviator on
that night several days ago, came back to him:
&ldquo;Looks like a jail delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it couldn&rsquo;t have been Colonel Chamberlain!&rdquo;
he told himself stoutly now. &ldquo;Or, if
it was, it surely was all right.&rdquo; He was determined
not to lose faith in a friend. &ldquo;&lsquo;Thine
own friend and thy father&rsquo;s friend forsake
not,&rsquo;&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon came. The day was
bright and clear. A brisk breeze from the west
was blowing loose papers across the diamond.
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Johnny exulted to himself. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll
be no soaring airplane today. But that ugly
pair will be up to something!&rdquo; His brow
wrinkled. Once again he murmured, &ldquo;I wonder
why.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The fame of the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; had traveled far.
The fact that he would once again appear had
been highly advertised. There is nothing like
a first class mystery to draw a crowd. The
crowd was there for sure. The bleachers were
packed and all available space overflowing
long before the game was scheduled to start.</p>
<p>The umpire had taken his place, the mysterious
pitcher was moving toward the box. Johnny
was staring dreamily at nothing at all,
when Goggles, with a strange look on his face,
came sidling up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo&mdash;Johnny!&rdquo; He stared through his thick
glasses. He fairly stammered in his excitement.
&ldquo;Johnny, you didn&rsquo;t see tho&mdash;those men
who ca&mdash;came back to g&mdash;get something out
of that bun&mdash;bungalow. Wan&mdash;want to see
them? Well, th&mdash;there they are! Right over
there, close to Big Tim Murphy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Tim!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s blood ran cold. Big
Tim had once been the promoter of a Sunday
baseball league. Could it be that Big Tim was
trying to get the ball park, that these two
were his aids?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>It flashed through Johnny&rsquo;s mind that he
might be behind the group who were seeking
to get control of their ball ground. &ldquo;Can it
be that Big Tim has hired these men to annoy
our pitcher?&rdquo; he asked himself. He hated to
think this. Big Tim was not like Big Bill Tyson.
He had very little money and he surely
was not soft and flabby. Big Tim worked.
&ldquo;Must give him the benefit of the doubt,&rdquo; he
decided.</p>
<p>That the strangers sitting close to Big Tim
were here for no good purpose became apparent
at once. Hardly had the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; taken
his place than they began to razz him.</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; heard them, he made no sign.
The throng that gathered that day had never
seen better pitching than came from his supple
arm during the first four innings of that game.</p>
<p>For all this, the mysterious pair became
more and more personal and cutting in their
shouts at that silent figure on the mound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should be put off the grounds!&rdquo; Goggles
fumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to mob &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>The affair came to a sudden climax as, at
the end of the fourth inning the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; on
his way to the bench passed close to the
strangers. Then it was that the larger of the
two, leaning far forward, called him a name.
He spoke low. It was not a pretty name. Few
heard it. Johnny heard. The pitcher too must
have heard, for his lips turned blue and
twitched in a manner painful to behold. He
did not speak. He marched straight on.</p>
<p>Big Tim Murphy must have heard, for, slowly
lifting his great bulk from his bleacher seat,
he stood towering above the two strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a-here!&rdquo; His tone was like the low
rumble of a lion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said enough. Fact
is, you&rsquo;ve said a few words too much.&rdquo; He
cleared his throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watchin&rsquo; these
boys with their ball game. They&rsquo;re puttin&rsquo; on
a good, clean, honest show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny felt a sudden ache in his throat. Big
Tim was championing their cause! Big Tim!</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for that pitcher,&rdquo; Tim went on, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know him&mdash;reckon there ain&rsquo;t many here that
does. But I been watchin&rsquo;. He ain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo;
to you. Not a thing! Not here. If he&rsquo;s
done things in other places, then you go there
to settle &rsquo;em. You can&rsquo;t spoil these boys&rsquo; baseball
game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> don&rsquo;t look like a Sunday School scholar!&rdquo;
the larger man sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;&rdquo; Tim&rsquo;s voice boomed. &ldquo;Just
for that, you&rsquo;ll apologize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a step forward. &ldquo;You called that
pitcher a name that in this town means an
apology or a fight! You&rsquo;ll beg that pitcher&rsquo;s
pardon. You&rsquo;ve got three minutes to do it.
An&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll pop your heads together
till they crack like pumpkins bustin&rsquo; on the
frozen ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do it too!&rdquo; Goggles whispered to
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But two of them!&rdquo; Johnny whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t matter. He&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim had dragged a huge watch from his
pocket. The men were silent. The whole
throng was still. The chirping notes of a robin
in a distant apple tree could be heard distinctly.
So a moment passed.</p>
<p>Big Tim did not move a muscle; just stood
there watching the second hand go around. So
another moment passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right.&rdquo; The larger of the two
strangers wet his lips. &ldquo;All right, you win.
Call that fellow over. I&rsquo;ll tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Tim roared, &ldquo;You pitcher! Come
over here! This fellow&rsquo;s got somethin&rsquo; to say
to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; came. The little ceremony was
soon over. Then the game was resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Tim,&rdquo; Johnny whispered, &ldquo;Even Big
Tim is with us! What a wonderful town this
is!&rdquo; Then a thought struck him with the force
of a blow. &ldquo;If only I had the thought-camera
I could take a picture of what&rsquo;s in those fellow&rsquo;s
minds.&rdquo; He was away like the wind.</p>
<p>He was back in fifteen minutes, but the place
where the strangers had been was vacant.
&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he murmured as a wave of keen disappointment
swept over him.</p>
<p>They were gone. But were they through?
He doubted that. What would they do next?
And why? There came no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>That was a red letter day for old Hillcrest.
The gate receipts were wonderful. Never in
the town&rsquo;s history had there been so many
paid admissions to a ball game. This crowd
had come to see a mysterious youth pitch a
ball game. They were not disappointed. The
&ldquo;Prince&rdquo; lasted the whole nine innings. After
the episode of Big Tim Murphy and the
strangers, he pitched like one inspired. In the
remaining innings only six men got on base
and none came home. The score at the end
stood 12 to 1. Again the Hillcrest rooters
went wild. Once more Johnny sighed deeply
as he murmured, &ldquo;Only one more game, and
the pennant will be won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That game was still nearly two weeks off.
When that game was played the Hillcrest team
would be back from their airplane cruise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be a triumphant return?&rdquo; he asked
himself. &ldquo;Will they bring home the money
needed to make the ball field truly our own?&rdquo;
He thought of the short dark man who had
seemed so determined that Irons O should
not be a success. He thought of the two
strangers, of the Chinaman Tao Sing, and of
the Federal agents. &ldquo;In that time,&rdquo; he told
himself, &ldquo;anything may happen, just anything
at all.&rdquo; And, as you shall see, many things did
happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />A NARROW ESCAPE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Meg!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was close
to a whisper. &ldquo;See those two slim fellows
that seem to be just hanging around in
front of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Meg&rsquo;s eyes shone. &ldquo;Who are they,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t matter just now.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone
was full of mystery. &ldquo;I want you to do something
for me. Those fellows are looking for a
little Chinaman named Tao Sing. I want to
know why. You ask them why for me, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Johnny.&rdquo; Meggy laughed. She
thought he was joking. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll tell me
just like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Johnny was serious. &ldquo;No, Meg, they
won&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ll not tell you, but they will tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you?&rdquo; Meggy stared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You know when you ask a person
about a thing, he is sure to <i>think</i> the answer.
He may not say it, but he thinks it all the same.
That&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll be lurking in the shadow
of that pillar. I&rsquo;ll get the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meggy gave him a long slow look. &ldquo;Johnny,
you&rsquo;re queer! But I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Johnny gripped her hand. &ldquo;Go
ahead. I&rsquo;ll be near by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes later, in her finest inquisitive-little-girl
tone of voice, Meggy said to one of
the strangers who, as you have guessed, was a
Federal agent, &ldquo;Mister, I heard you were looking
for Tao Sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The slender young man started.
&ldquo;Do you know where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; Meg drawled, &ldquo;not just now, I
don&rsquo;t. But I&mdash;I just wondered why you wanted
that innocent looking little fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Federal agent favored Meg with a
searching glance. &ldquo;Well, sister&mdash;&rdquo; he returned
her drawl. &ldquo;Truth is that Tao Sing has been
teaching all the little Chinks to play marbles
for keeps. We don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to play
marbles for keeps. Do we, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His partner
chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you just don&rsquo;t want to tell me.&rdquo; Meggy
put on a good imitation of goo-goo eyes.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you give me to find him for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find him?&rdquo; The agent was serious again.
&ldquo;Plenty, sister! Good and plenty! A new
dress, a silk one, or a bicycle&mdash;anything. Just
you bring him around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo; Meggy glided away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; she whispered a moment later,
&ldquo;did you get it? Did you read his thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I did,&rdquo; Johnny replied slowly.
&ldquo;And again, perhaps I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, you&rsquo;re queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am. Tell you what, Meg!&rdquo;
Johnny came to a sudden resolve. &ldquo;Meet me
at the heart of The Pines at eleven tomorrow
morning. I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret?&rdquo; Meggy thrilled. &ldquo;How grand!
I&rsquo;ll be there, Johnny.&rdquo; She vanished into the
dark.</p>
<p>For days Johnny had been fairly bursting
with his secret&mdash;the story of that strange and
seemingly improbable, if not quite impossible,
thing, the thought-camera. He could not bear
to think of keeping that secret alone. He
would tell Meggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Just now, however, a question was burning
in his mind. Had he got a real picture of the
thoughts in that Federal agent&rsquo;s mind? Perhaps
he should not have tried this. Perhaps
it was his duty to walk right up to them and
tell what he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May do that tomorrow,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>Of a sudden Johnny felt a wave of loneliness
sweep over him. He sensed the reason
at once. Early that morning a great silver
airplane had come swooping down from the
sky. It had gathered up the Hillcrest ball players,
Doug Danby, Fred Frame and all the rest.
Goggles and Hop Horner had stored the steel-fingered
mechanical pitcher in the wings of
the plane, then had climbed into the cabin
with the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the little dark man with you,&rdquo;
Johnny had laughed. &ldquo;The one you know who
took such an interest in Irons O.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Goggles bantered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve stowed Irons O away with the baggage
in the wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Johnny advised, &ldquo;keep an
eye out for him, and don&rsquo;t take any wooden
quarters at the gate. Goodbye and good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>These last words had fairly stuck in his
throat. How he wanted to join them on that
trip! But that was impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably be exciting enough right here in
old Hillcrest,&rdquo; he now told himself philosophically.
He was not wrong.</p>
<p>He had turned his steps toward home when
the many-colored lights from the windows of
the Chinese Chamber of Commerce fell upon
his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go in and have one more shot at
that rich and wise old Wung Lu,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;May be more to his thoughts than appears
on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He entered the big room just as he had done
many times before. He found the rich and
wise one sitting, as was his custom during the
evening hours, contemplating the fat and smiling
Buddha that stood against the wall.</p>
<p>Tonight, as he crept into a corner, Johnny
thought there was in the smile of the Buddha
something crafty and dangerous. This, of
course, was pure imagination. The Buddha,
which had been carved from the trunk of a
great tree many centuries ago, had never been
known to utter a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Johnny did not care so much for the Buddha.
Banners and dragons interested him
more. He liked to think of small Chinese
ladies working over the banners that hung on
the walls&mdash;days, months, perhaps years, drawing
marvelous pictures in silk, stitch by stitch.
&ldquo;Every banner says something,&rdquo; Wung Lu
had told him once. Tonight, as he sat staring
at a blue and white banner, Johnny was seized
with a desire to know its meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Wung Lu,&rdquo; he broke in
upon the wise one&rsquo;s meditations at last, &ldquo;what
does that banner say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says, my son,&rdquo; replied the Chinese merchant
soberly, &ldquo;that he who gets knowledge
and discovers secrets by hard labor shall reap
a reward, but he who obtains them some easy
way will have cause for regret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started and stared. Did Wung Lu
know of the thought-camera? Was this some
sort of warning? He could not so much as
guess the answer, for Wung Lu&rsquo;s round face
was as silent and expressionless as a placid
lake at sunset.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>The thought disturbed him. Soon he excused
himself and started for home. While
still in Chinatown, passing a narrow alley, he
was startled by two dark figures leaping at
him from the dark. Johnny was quick. He
could run and dodge like a hare. This was his
golden opportunity. Dodging to the right, he
missed the two figures only by inches, caught
a glimpse of their tense yellow faces, then
shot away at a desperate pace.</p>
<p>He would soon have outdistanced them but
for one thing. So startled was he that he at
once lost his direction. Before he realized it,
with his pursuers hot on his tracks, he found
himself in a blind corner. The street, ending
in a wall, closed him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got&mdash;got to get out of here,&rdquo; he thought
with a touch of despair.</p>
<p>The steel frame of a building in process of
erection loomed above him. Before him, erected
to keep onlookers out, was a high board
fence.</p>
<p>One thing saved him. A large sign, POST
NO BILLS, had been nailed to this wall. More
than an inch thick, the frame about this sign
offered a precarious hand and foot hold. He
went up and over like a cat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>There were, however, others with climbing
ability. Before he could catch his breath and
ask himself, &ldquo;What can they want?&rdquo; the foremost
of the men was atop the fence.</p>
<p>Before Johnny was the steel framework of
the new building. So, up he went, one story,
two, three, with the little yellow men only one
jump behind. At the top was a swinging
crane. From it a long chain dangled. Across
a narrow space, not fifteen feet away, was the
roof of a building. &ldquo;Get the chain swinging,&rdquo;
he thought excitedly. &ldquo;Swing over. Jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the chain began to swing. His pursuer&rsquo;s
hoarse breathing came to him as he let
go and swung out over space.</p>
<p>A breath-taking second over a hard pavement,
and he dropped, still clinging to the
chain, safely upon the roof at the other side.</p>
<p>Wrapping the chain about a flagpole, without
turning to look back, he disappeared
among the chimneys at the top of the broad
apartment building.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, still breathing hard, he
entered his own home and went at once to his
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a lot to know what they wanted,&rdquo;
he thought soberly. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s one time when
the old thought-camera didn&rsquo;t help a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a full hour of serious thinking he decided
on a very definite course of action which,
he assured himself, should be begun on the
very next day.</p>
<p>He had decided to confide all his secrets to
someone older and he believed, much wiser
than himself. This, we have reason to believe,
is a wise course of action for any boy who finds
himself bewildered by the strange circumstances
that surround his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first I&rsquo;ll keep my promise to Meg,&rdquo; he
assured himself before he fell asleep.</p>

<br />THE FLYING BALL TEAM</h2>
<p>At the heart of The Pines next morning,
Johnny found Meg seated on a log waiting.
This spot, so quiet and secluded, disturbed
only by the chirp of a robin and the
chatter of a squirrel, held for them many pleasant
memories. Here, as small children, they
had tumbled on the grass. Here, in early
&rsquo;teens, together with other playmates, they
had done cart wheels and wild, hilarious Indian
dances. Now it was a sober-faced, eager
Meggy who awaited him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; she exclaimed with a little catch
of breath, &ldquo;what are you going to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you helped me a lot last night, that I
can find out anything that any person is thinking,
and that at this moment I&rsquo;m scared stiff.&rdquo;
With a heavy sigh Johnny dropped to a place
beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Johnny?&rdquo; She gripped his arm.
&ldquo;Why are you frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Chinaman, Tao Sing! There&rsquo;s a
tong war, and I&rsquo;m in the midst of it&mdash;or at
least I&rsquo;m likely to be. But then&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny
checked this wild flow of words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better
start at the beginning. It all began when that
little Chinaman loaned me that thought-camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought-camera!&rdquo; Meggy stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo; So, seated
there in the sun with only a robin and a squirrel,
as he supposed, listening in, he told Meg
the amazing story of Tao Sing&rsquo;s great invention
and some of its startling revelations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last night,&rdquo; he said, pausing to catch
his breath, &ldquo;last night I squinted the thought-camera
first at the Federal agent, and then at
that wise old owl Wung Lu up there in the
Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Then, after
I&rsquo;d been chased and almost captured by some
wild-eyed Chinks, I sneaked along home to
develop those last think-o-graphs. And what
do you suppose the thoughts of that Federal
agent told me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Meggy&rsquo;s breath came quick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That a Chinese tong war has started with
half a hundred Chinamen carrying big blue
pistols, and any one of these ready to start
popping at any moment, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny broke off abruptly. &ldquo;What was
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Meggy was all aquiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something back in the pines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny sprang back into the pine boughs.
He found nothing. &ldquo;Perhaps it was a squirrel,&rdquo;
he said quietly when he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now you see,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m between
the devil and the deep blue sea. The
thought-camera belongs to Tao Sing. He
loaned it to me. I should return it. But where
is he? A tong war is a terrible thing. It&rsquo;s a
fight between two Chinese secret societies. If
it gets going right, several people will be
killed. On the Pacific coast two Chinamen
have been killed. The thing is spreading. Tao
Sing is at the bottom of it all. He&rsquo;s in this
country without permission. These two Federal
agents know he&rsquo;s been here&mdash;found his
finger-prints at the back of the Chinese spice
shop. Perhaps someone has told them I know
about Tao Sing&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure. Someone <i>does</i>
know I have the thought-camera, or at least
they think I have. That&rsquo;s why I was chased
last night. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo; Johnny mopped
his brow. &ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose I helped Tao Sing
discover secrets. Probably when I brought
him Wung Lu&rsquo;s think-o-graphs he read what
he wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meggy,&rdquo; Johnny said solemnly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
no good in stealing anyone else&rsquo;s thoughts!
This thought-camera! I&rsquo;d like to give it back
right now. But I can&rsquo;t. Tao Sing has vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, let me see it,&rdquo; Meg whispered.</p>
<p>Johnny drew the thought-camera from beneath
his coat. Meg looked at it, starry-eyed
as she might had she seen a ghost. &ldquo;Johnny,
where do you keep it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Meg, shaking herself as if to
waken from a bad dream, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the strangest
thing I ever heard of. It&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Her voice dropped. &ldquo;I heard
something back there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Johnny shuddered. &ldquo;This place
is haunted today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Together they hurried away through the
pines and were soon upon the sunlit streets of
old Hillcrest.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime the &ldquo;Flying Ball Team,&rdquo;
as someone had aptly named it, had arrived at
its first destination, and things were doing.</p>
<p>They arrived an hour before sundown, after
a thrilling ride high in air, at the little city of
Cannon Ball on the wheat-growing Dakota
prairies.</p>
<p>The moment their plane came to a standstill,
they were surrounded by a crowd of boys,
shouting: &ldquo;Where is he? Where is he? Show
him to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s who?&rdquo; Doug asked with a smile.</p>
<p>For reply one boy held up a crumpled handbill
on which had been pictured a grotesque
mechanical man with sparks shooting from his
finger tips and flames of fire pouring from his
nostrils. Beneath were the words:</p>
<p>IRONS O, THE STEEL-FINGERED
PITCHER WHO LIVES ON FIRE. SEE
HIM PERFORM AT THE BALL FIELD
TOMORROW!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>At sight of this, Doug felt his knees sag.
&ldquo;Somebody,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;has been over-playing
the thing. And now if we fail! Man!
Oh man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he? Where is he?&rdquo; the boys were
still shouting. &ldquo;Show him to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He goes to bed an hour before sundown.&rdquo;
Doug chuckled in spite of himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
asleep in one of the plane&rsquo;s wings now. You
can&rsquo;t see him until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; came in a disappointed
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good place to leave him,&rdquo; Sheeley
the pilot whispered to Doug. &ldquo;Nothing like a
little secrecy to make people keen for a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will he be safe there?&rdquo; Doug&rsquo;s brow
wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Oh sure!&rdquo; Sheeley assured him. &ldquo;In
a place like this, I roll up in my blankets and
sleep on the cabin floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Doug and Goggles wandered away from
the town to have a look at the glorious rolling
prairies. Lit up as they were by the slanting
rays of the setting sun, they offered the boys
a view that time would never erase from their
memories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it!&rdquo; said Doug, &ldquo;tomorrow the
wheat country; the next day the cattle country;
then the gold-mining city. After that
Spokane, and then the Pacific coast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure.&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; tone was a bit
gloomy. &ldquo;If we fail tomorrow, this place is
our only destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired,&rdquo; Doug said reassuringly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better tomorrow.&rdquo; He did; but
not for long.</p>
<p>The fame of the mechanical pitcher who,
with his steel fingers, could pitch a curve like
a flesh and blood man, had spread afar in this
land of golden grain. This was a slack period
for wheat farmers. They began pouring in before
noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have such a crowd as that there ball
ground never saw before!&rdquo; a tall, lanky lad in
a ten gallon hat assured Goggles. You might
believe this would stir up in the boy&rsquo;s mind a
feeling of joy. Instead, it made him feel shivery
all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be careful,&rdquo; he said to Hop
Horner. &ldquo;Every crowd&rsquo;s a mob. You can never
tell what it&rsquo;s going to do when things go
sort of queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s going to be O.K.,&rdquo; Hop said
coolly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>The appointed hour arrived at last. Never
had the boys from the quiet little city of Hillcrest
seen such a crowd, and never had they
looked upon such a sea of sun-tanned faces.</p>
<p>Irons O had been carried secretly to the
grounds in a covered truck. Assembled within
the shelter of the truck, he was then assisted
with much ceremony and shouting to his place
in the pitcher&rsquo;s box. Solemnly the Hillcrest
boys took their places in the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The zero hour has arrived,&rdquo; Goggles muttered
to Hop. His tongue stuck to the roof
of his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game! Game!&rdquo; shouted a group of high
school boys in a corner. &ldquo;We want baseball!
We want baseball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mister!&rdquo; a small boy in the front row
squeaked. &ldquo;Make him spit fire, will ye?&rdquo; Everyone
laughed.</p>
<p>Only one person sat staring in silence. That
was Doug Danby. Sitting alone in the bleachers,
he had caught sight of a vaguely familiar
face. At this moment he was staring at the
person in open-mouthed astonishment. &ldquo;How
did he get there? How could he?&rdquo; he was asking
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong,&rdquo; he hopefully reassured
himself. Something told him he was
not. A voice seemed to whisper in his ear,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in for it, all right. That is really the
same little dark man who caused you so much
trouble at home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the little dark man himself, he sat
staring at Irons O, and on his face was a look
hard to describe. It was a look in which was
mingled hate, contempt and triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; the umpire roared. He was a
western man of the old school. &ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goggles threw a switch. He pressed a button.
With a circular sweep of his ludicrous
head and a broad grin, Irons O lifted his good
right arm; then, to Goggles&rsquo; utter dismay,
swung it around three times instead of once,
to at last discharge the ball in the manner of
a cannon. The batter and the catcher both saw
the action and dodged, each in good time.
Quite unembarrassed by the wire screen behind
the catcher, the ball went right on
through to lose itself on the boundless prairies
of the Dakotas. The crowd let out a terrible
roar. But Goggles murmured weakly, &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
gone wrong again at the very start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />A REVELATION IN CHINESE</h2>
<p>That something had surely gone wrong
with Irons O, the mechanical pitcher,
there could be no doubt. After making a hasty
adjustment, Goggles and Hop Horner gave
him a second ball and one more chance. This
time his behavior was worse than ever. Swinging
his arm about in a circle four times, he
sent the ball speeding over the catcher&rsquo;s head,
on over the low screen netting, and away into
the blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; a big voice roared from the crowd.
This was greeted with a wild scream of merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first stop on the grand tour!&rdquo; Goggles
groaned once more. &ldquo;A failure here, and we&rsquo;re
through.&rdquo; In his mind he saw the baseball
grounds of his home town deserted on Saturday,
but crowded to over-flowing on Sunday
afternoons. He heard wild shouts disturbing
the sober citizens&rsquo; rest, saw autos full of pleasure
seekers, shouting through the town. Then
he muttered low: &ldquo;We must not fail!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hop!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone
back of all this trouble. I&rsquo;m going to find out
who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For ten minutes both he and Hop worked
feverishly, their trembling fingers serving
them badly, when a quiet voice from behind
them said: &ldquo;Take your time, boys. Don&rsquo;t get
excited. You are hoping to entertain a quiet
peace-loving and patient people. They will
not fail you.&rdquo; The speaker was a little man in
steel-rimmed spectacles and a long black coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old-fashioned minister,&rdquo; Goggles
thought, swallowing hard to keep back tears.
&ldquo;God bless him! Everyone here loves him,
I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man went on talking slowly, quietly,
reassuringly. &ldquo;These Dakota farmers plant
wheat. If the hail does not beat it down, if a
prairie fire does not destroy it, if a drought
does not dry it up&mdash;they get a good crop. If
there is no crop, they plant again next year.
They are patient. They can wait now, and
they will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>It is strange what confidence such quiet assurance
can inspire in a boy&rsquo;s mind. Five minutes
had not passed before the boys had things
adjusted and old Irons O was ready to pitch a
perfect game.</p>
<p>The boys from the wheat belt put up a game
defense, but they were no match for the Hillcrest
team and their steel-fingered pitcher. At
the end of the game the score stood 14 to 8 in
Hillcrest&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won!&rdquo; Dave Tobin, who had
come along as financial manager, exclaimed
enthusiastically. &ldquo;And say! You should see
the wad of bills I have for the ball grounds at
home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Goggles thought a trifle wearily, &ldquo;we
won.&rdquo; Truth is, he was not thinking of this at
all. Instead, he was asking himself, &ldquo;How is it
that Irons O gets his insides all mixed up before
every game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheeley,&rdquo; he said a half hour later, &ldquo;our
mechanical pitcher got all mussed up while he
was inside one of your wings.&rdquo; (He always
thought of the planes as wings.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it?&rdquo; Sheeley was incredulous.
&ldquo;Locked up tight all the time. And I&rsquo;m the
only one that has a key. Fine lock too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; the boy thought to himself,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ride to our next stop right there
in that wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course it wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he thought
a moment later. &ldquo;Fantastic sort of notion.
Sheeley wouldn&rsquo;t like it. And yet&mdash;&lsquo;mystery
wings.&rsquo;&rdquo; He whispered these two last words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get a different crowd next time,&rdquo; Doug
said. He had just come up. &ldquo;Cattle men. Cowboys.
Do you suppose they are a patient lot
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they won&rsquo;t need to be,&rdquo; Goggles
smiled. &ldquo;Cowboys! Well, you don&rsquo;t think of
them as a quiet sort of people. Whirling over
the prairie shouting enough to split your ears&mdash;that&rsquo;s
my notion of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; Doug asked in a low tone, &ldquo;who do
you suppose I saw in the crowd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little dark man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! How&rsquo;d he get here? Where is he
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s vanished. Been looking all over for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what it means?&rdquo; said Goggles.
&ldquo;Wonder if he&rsquo;ll be at the next place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery wings!&rdquo; he murmured once more
as he hurried away. Why did he say that?
Perhaps he himself could not have told.</p>
<p class="tb">That same afternoon Johnny took his secret
regarding the thought-camera to good old Professor
George. He did not tell him all he knew,
not nearly all, but enough to, in a way, outline
the problem. What he really wished to know
was, just how much right he had to keep such
a secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, I suppose,&rdquo; the old man replied
thoughtfully, &ldquo;is a question you will have to
decide for yourself. Secret knowledge is rather
strange. What your rights are in regard to it
has never been decided; that is, when the law
does not come in. Of course, if it&rsquo;s a question
of someone breaking the law, then your duty&rsquo;s
clear. You&rsquo;ve got to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>The old professor was very wise. &ldquo;And Johnny&mdash;&rdquo;
he leaned forward quite suddenly.
&ldquo;Seems to me this affair between the two
Chinamen needs looking into. Why should
Tao Sing wish to know what Wung Lu is
thinking? Does he want to profit by Wung
Lu&rsquo;s wisdom? Well, perhaps&mdash;if it has to do
with buying and selling, making money. But
pure wisdom, the wisdom of ancient Chinese
scholars? Never a bit of it. It&rsquo;s all written
down where he can read it if he chooses to do
so. I doubt if you have a right to carry Wung
Lu&rsquo;s thoughts to Tao Sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been wondering,&rdquo; Johnny said uneasily.</p>
<p>Again the professor had spoken more truth
than he guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the think-o-graphs you made
last night,&rdquo; Professor George said quite suddenly,
&ldquo;the one you took of Wung Lu&rsquo;s
thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it to Captain Gallagher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To&mdash;to the police?&rdquo; Johnny stared. &ldquo;He
couldn&rsquo;t read it. It&rsquo;s all in Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has an interpreter who can. He&rsquo;s to be
trusted. I know him,&rdquo; the professor replied
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-l-l,&rdquo; Johnny said slowly. Go to the police?
He had asked this old man in to help
clear things up. It looked now as if they were
more tangled than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Their visit to the police station had the most
astonishing results. When the think-o-graph
of Wung Lu&rsquo;s thoughts had been placed under
the magnifying lens, the tiny mechanism started,
and when the Chinese police interpreter
was told to look into the microscope-like affair
and watch the words go by, the result was
most startling. At first he just stood there
squinting into the glass. Then of a sudden he
let out a wild howl and went dancing around
the room as if he had been stung by a bee.</p>
<p>Johnny stopped the mechanism and waited.
When at last the interpreter had regained
proper control of himself, he stepped to his
place once more. But not for long.</p>
<p>Leaping into the air he let out one more
wild howl, began calling out all sorts of
strange Oriental names and would have bolted
out of the door had not Chief Gallagher
blocked the door.</p>
<p>Seizing the interpreter by the arm, the Chief
dragged him into his private office and closed
the door.</p>
<p>For a full quarter of an hour only the low
rumble of voices from the inner room disturbed
the silence of the police station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>When the Chief and his interpreter returned
the Chinaman appeared a shade paler, but
seemed quite calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; (Johnny had been thinking hard
during that fifteen minute conference), &ldquo;perhaps
I should tell you, there&rsquo;s a pair of Federal
agents hanging around. I&mdash;I think they&rsquo;re
working on this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; the Chief exclaimed.
&ldquo;Fact is, we&rsquo;re working with &rsquo;em hand in hand.
That&rsquo;s where I got a lot of my information.
But Johnny!&rdquo; His voice rumbled. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
harm in givin&rsquo; the local police a break. Is there
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of harm.&rdquo; Johnny grinned happily.
He liked the Chief. Long years ago the
Chief had saved him from a terrible beating
by some older boys.</p>
<p>The Chief signaled Johnny to start the
mechanism once more. The interpreter took
his place and saw the thing through to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said the Chief, &ldquo;do you think you
could get one more of these&mdash;er&mdash;what is it
you call &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think-o-graphs,&rdquo; Johnny grinned, &ldquo;of
Wung Lu? Well, if&mdash;if it seems to be my
duty.&rdquo; Johnny shuddered slightly. &ldquo;But not
at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time you say.&rdquo; The Chief&rsquo;s face was
sober. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important. I don&rsquo;t mind telling
you that you may have prevented a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a tragedy. Yes,&rdquo; Johnny replied quietly,
&ldquo;I had sort of guessed that. You wouldn&rsquo;t
mind telling me just a little, would you?&rdquo; he
asked timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; the Chief smiled, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t
you will be turnin&rsquo; that mind readin&rsquo; machine
on me an&rsquo; then there&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; what you&rsquo;d
be findin&rsquo; out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you this much.&rdquo; His voice dropped
to a mere whisper. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of these
Chinese secret societies called tongs? Well,
it has to do with that. Your old friend Wung
Lu belongs to a tong. He&rsquo;s done somethin&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s displeasin&rsquo; to another tong. Probably
nothin&rsquo; illegal, just short tradin&rsquo; or somethin&rsquo;.
So they&rsquo;ve decided to get him out of their
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho&mdash;shoot him?&rdquo; Johnny stared. This
had never occurred to him as a possibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; like that. Queer part is,&rdquo; the
Chief rumbled, &ldquo;Wung Lu knows all about it
but he won&rsquo;t tell. They&rsquo;re like a lot of boys,
these Orientals. Just go about settlin&rsquo; their
own affairs. But this is too serious to let them
settle. We know the men we want and we&rsquo;ve
got to go get &rsquo;em. One of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s this wrinkle-faced
little fellow Tao Sing. He an&rsquo; his pals
are in the United States illegally. We&rsquo;ll just
send &rsquo;em back where they came from&mdash;if we
can catch &rsquo;em. And that,&rdquo; the Chief ended, &ldquo;is
about all I can tell you just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to himself as he lay
in his bed that night. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to make a
fellow&rsquo;s head whirl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />ETHER AND MOTH-BALLS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;For once old Irons O is fit as a fiddle.&rdquo;
Goggles heaved a sigh of relief. Hours
had passed. They had gone sweeping high
above the prairies, had tilted the nose of their
plane upward and had gone roaring over the
Rockies. Now here they were in the little
cattle-country city of Broken Bow, ready for
the second game of their unusual tour.</p>
<p>The city was not marvelous but the crowd,
the boy thought with a thrill and a shudder,
was immense and rather terrifying. Banked in
rows to the right of the narrow bleachers were
hundreds of cowboys. They had not dismounted,
but were seated easily in saddle, awaiting
the opening of the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong this time!&rdquo; Hop Horner
agreed. &ldquo;But just to make sure, we&rsquo;ll put a
few over the plate.&rdquo; He called to the catcher.
Goggles set the levers, placed a ball between
the steel fingers, then pushed a button.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never behaved better!&rdquo; was Hop&rsquo;s pronouncement
after five minutes of practice that
set the crowd to staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better give him a little gas before we start,&rdquo;
Goggles suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Hop took up a gallon can and
poured half its contents into the small tank
concealed in the iron pitcher&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! What&rsquo;s that queer smell!&rdquo; Goggles
exclaimed as Hop set the can on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something drifting in on the wind,&rdquo; Hop
said quietly. &ldquo;Sort of smells like a hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad sign!&rdquo; Goggles laughed. He was more
right than he thought.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the teams were all ready
to go. Goggles set the levers and threw the
switch. From somewhere within the iron
pitcher&rsquo;s strange being came an unaccustomed
sound. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t breathe right.&rdquo; The boy was a
trifle startled. &ldquo;And look, he&rsquo;s really spouting
fire from his iron nostrils. Some&mdash;something&rsquo;s
gone wrong again! And we thought nothing
could!&rdquo; He was ready to give up in despair.</p>
<p>Hop threw off the controls, unbolted the
back plate and started a careful inspection. He
took plenty of time, testing out every wire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you there&rsquo;s nothing wrong,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>All this had kept the crowd waiting and it
was growing impatient. There were shouts of
&ldquo;Play ball! Play ball!&rdquo; from every corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; Goggles groaned.
&ldquo;The crowd will be on the field in a minute.
But we can&rsquo;t let old Irons O burn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! They&rsquo;re coming! At least one is.&rdquo;
Hop pointed to a huge cowboy riding toward
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Goggles sighed, &ldquo;We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look Buddy!&rdquo; The big cowboy&rsquo;s tone was
deep and mellow. &ldquo;Do you all plan to play a
ball game with that iron thing this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we mean to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this ain&rsquo;t no trick to git our money?&rdquo;
The big man looked him squarely in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not!&rdquo; Goggles returned his look. &ldquo;If
the game doesn&rsquo;t start in twenty minutes,
you&rsquo;ll all get your money back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough!&rdquo; The big man wheeled about
and rode away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hop!&rdquo; Goggles said suddenly, &ldquo;Do you
suppose it&rsquo;s the gas?&rdquo; Seizing the gallon can,
he removed the cap and, holding it up, took
one big sniff of its contents. Next instant both
boy and can went tumbling to the earth.</p>
<p>Goggles was down for only the count of ten.
He came up sputtering. &ldquo;Ether! Ether and
moth-balls! Someone has loaded up our can.
Drain the tank. Throw that can away. Get
some real gas, then we&rsquo;re off.&rdquo; And they were!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ether and moth-balls!&rdquo; Sheeley the air
pilot chuckled to Goggles a half hour later.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rare combination. Load a flivver up
with that stuff and it&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s a Rolls Royce
or an airplane right off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who could have done that?&rdquo; Goggles
said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>As for the game, from that time on it was a
huge success. Never had the boys and their
iron pitcher received such a hand. Nor did
Irons O lose any of his popularity when, for
some unknown reason, he got a trifle wild, gave
two bases on balls, let in a runner with a wild
pitch, and finally lost the game 9 to 7.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re real sports!&rdquo; the big cowboy complimented
Doug and Goggles later that evening.
&ldquo;You came all this way in a big airplane
to play our boys a ball game, then you give &rsquo;em
a break and let &rsquo;em win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t <i>let</i> them win,&rdquo; Goggles said quite
frankly. &ldquo;They just took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;even
an iron pitcher has his off days. Old soup-bone
gets tired don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; The big fellow grinned
broadly. &ldquo;Wish you all sorts of good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luck!&rdquo; Goggles said to Hop. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;m going to need, for sure as my name&rsquo;s
Goggles I&rsquo;m going to ride to the next stop
inside one of those wings of mystery, right
along with our old iron pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo; Hop stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Plenty of room. Safe there as
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all there was said about it, but
when they took off a few hours later, Goggles
did not occupy his accustomed seat in the airplane
cabin.</p>
<p>Pilot Sheeley had offered no objection to the
boy&rsquo;s plan of riding inside the airplane&rsquo;s wing.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find it very exciting. It&rsquo;ll be a bit
bumpy. You won&rsquo;t be able to see a thing, and
we&rsquo;ll be passing over some gorgeous country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May see enough!&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;Someone
has been tampering with our iron man&mdash;done
it three times. I&rsquo;m going to find out how
and why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recalled his own words as, lying flat
along the inside of the plane, he felt the throb
of motors and knew they were on their way.
&ldquo;I wonder if I shall!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>At the back of him were the parts of the
steel-fingered pitcher. Before him, and on the
other side of the trapdoor through which he
had crawled, was a large roll of canvas. &ldquo;Probably
used for covering the motors in severe
weather when there is no hangar near,&rdquo; he
thought.</p>
<p>What did he expect as he lay there feeling
the lift and drop of the plane as she swung
along through the air? He hardly knew. He
suspected that somehow, someone had a means
of getting into the plane after the ship was on
the ground.</p>
<p>Whatever he expected, he had not long to
wait, for all of a sudden as he stared at that
roll of canvas, a head appeared above it. A
small figure dragged itself over the canvas into
the space before it. The boy barely escaped
uttering an audible gasp. It was the little dark
man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>That night as he slept in his second-story
bedroom of his grandfather&rsquo;s house, Johnny
was troubled by strange dreams. He seemed
to be riding on a limitless sea in a cockle-shell
of a boat. The wind began to whisper across
the small waves. It blew a whiff of air into
his face. Then, with astonishing speed, it rose
into a gale, driving damp spray against his
cheek, and set his frail bark rocking perilously.
The little craft climbed a wave, another, and
yet another. It rose, then seeming to rear on
high, came splashing down to dive, prow foremost,
into the foam.</p>
<p>It was just as Johnny caught his breath, prepared
to withstand this chilling plunge, that
he awoke.</p>
<p>For a full moment, quite bewildered, he
stared about him. At last, shaking himself, he
murmured, &ldquo;There was no storm. It was a
dream. I am in my grandfather&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with a sudden start, he sat up wide
awake and staring. It was true there was no
storm and no sea. For all that, the wind was
blowing strongly into his window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wide
open!&rdquo; His bare feet hit the floor. &ldquo;And I left
it open only a crack!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Leaping to the window, he looked down.
&ldquo;Ah! I thought so!&rdquo; A tall ladder leaned
against the house. It reached his window.
Whirling about, he looked where his trunk had
been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;My trunk&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not thought of that as a possibility.
Now he realized how absurdly easy it had
been. His trunk was small&mdash;an old army
locker. The window was large. &ldquo;What could
be easier?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Slipping on his trousers, he crept down the
stairs and out on the dew-drenched grass.</p>
<p>In a shadowy spot at the back of the house
he found the trunk. The frail lock had been
pried up. The thought-camera and his entire
collection of think-o-graphs were gone. &ldquo;As if
they had never been,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Shouldering his trunk, he climbed the ladder
and slid it back into his room. After that
he carried the ladder to its place on some hooks
against the wood-shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow&rsquo;s foolish to keep a ladder outside
his house,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Invites thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>For all that, as he tiptoed back up the stairs,
he experienced a surprising sense of relief. The
thought-camera, he supposed, was gone for
good, and with it a great deal of his responsibility
in the matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />LIQUID AIR&mdash;ALMOST</h2>
<p>In the wing of the airplane, sailing high
above the western prairies, Goggles was in
a tight place. He had never been in a tighter
one and never expected to be in the future, if
indeed there was to be a future.</p>
<p>Just what had he expected when he crawled
into that narrow place? Certainly not this.
Perhaps he had hoped that someone would unlock
the trap door after they landed. Then he
would catch him. But now, as he thought all
this, and his head went into a whirl, the little
dark man looked up and saw him. For one
full minute he did not speak or move; only his
beady eyes bored into the boy&rsquo;s very soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think I did a good enough job messing things
up? Well then, you and the Big Shot are
agreed. But what&rsquo;s he want?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Goggles spoke slowly. He
was thinking hard. He was, as we have said,
in a tight enough place surely. Securely sealed
up in a duramen tube a half mile in air with no
means of communicating with his friends and
with this enemy staring him in the face, his
situation was anything but pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to spoil things for us?&rdquo;
he asked in as quiet a tone as he could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;why, now I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The little man
laughed mirthlessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m paid to do it. I do
what I&rsquo;m paid to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time the boy was thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to get the better of him. I must do it. But
how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved a little. Something poked into
his side. What was that? Oh yes, he remembered.
A bottle! A sudden desperate plan
came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he spoke slowly, &ldquo;as long as we&rsquo;re
here, we may as well talk about something.
Let&rsquo;s make it liquid air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air ain&rsquo;t no liquid,&rdquo; the little man protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it is.&rdquo; Goggles&rsquo; courage was
growing. &ldquo;You can make it liquid by putting
it under very high pressure and getting it
down to 216 degrees below zero. When it gets
into liquid form you may keep it in a bottle
for three or four days.&rdquo; At this point he pulled
the flat bottle from his pocket. It was half
filled with a pale liquid. The little man stared
at the bottle. &ldquo;Liquid air is strange stuff,&rdquo;
Goggles went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold, colder than the
North Pole. Put a fresh rose in it for a second,
take it out and you can pinch it into a powder.
Put a steel clock spring in it, take it out
and it will snap like glass. Stick your finger
in a bottle of it and I&rsquo;ll break it off like an
icicle.&rdquo; He thrust the bottle out before him.
The little man seemed to shrink back.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s tone did not change. He might
have been a professor lecturing to a class.
&ldquo;Yes, liquid air is strange. I could pour it over
my hand, or even put it in my mouth and, providing
I got rid of it at once, it would not harm
me. One minute of holding a spoonful in my
mouth would mean death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I were to pour even a small amount down
your neck&mdash;&rdquo; (he drew himself forward ever
so little), &ldquo;which I could&mdash;I&rsquo;m strong. Much
stronger than you think. I have strong fingers
and arms. If I poured a quarter of a bottle
down your back you would die. No one would
guess what killed you. The liquid air would
turn to gas and there you&rsquo;d be. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange look of terror came into the little
man&rsquo;s eyes as he cried in a shrill high-pitched
voice, &ldquo;You let me be! Don&rsquo;t touch me! I&rsquo;ll
leave at the next stop, and you&rsquo;ll never see me
again. So help me, you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goggles settled back in his place. As he did
so, his right hand was closed about the bottle,
carefully concealing a printed label.</p>
<p>After that the big bi-motored plane with its
flying baseball team in its cabin and that curious
cargo in its wings sped across the land.
Not once did Goggles relinquish his hold on
that magic bottle. From time to time the little
dark man spoke. His words were always in
the nature of a confession. He had been hired
by Big Bill Tyson to break up this trip. He
had not been told why&mdash;he had only been paid
to do it. He knew about locks. Locks had always
been easy for him. He had a key to the
lock on the door to this place. How? Well,
that did not matter. He hadn&rsquo;t succeeded in
breaking up the cruise. Now he was going to
quit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, rolling his eyes horribly as
he took one more look at the magic bottle,
&ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;m going to quit! Just let me out of
this place and you&rsquo;ll never see me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he only knew!&rdquo; Goggles thought with an
inward shudder. &ldquo;If he knew, I wonder what
would happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, well, he had this little dark fellow within
his power, that was enough. So the plane
sped on.</p>
<p>Never in all his life had the boy experienced
such a sense of relief as, after the plane had
bumped on some landing field, then gone gliding
along to a stop, he saw the little dark man
slip like a snake through the small door and
disappear.</p>
<p>He grinned a broad grin as he dropped the
flat bottle back into his pocket. &ldquo;Lucky
break!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Wonder if Sheeley
missed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Irons O will do his full duty at this
place,&rdquo; he assured Doug as he came out to
meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo; Doug was still in
doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure as anything. But just to make it a
cinch, ask one of the boys to watch this plane
while I go for a cup of coffee. I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard was arranged for at once. As the
two boys hurried away, Goggles pulled a bottle
out of his pocket. &ldquo;Just read the label on
that, will you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I packed my glasses
in my bag by mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Doug took the bottle. &ldquo;It says,
&lsquo;Dr. Jordan&rsquo;s Face Lotion. Good for sun-burned
and chapped skin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for more than that&mdash;sometimes,&rdquo;
Goggles chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Doug demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you sometime,&rdquo; Goggles chuckled
again. &ldquo;Belongs to Sheeley, that bottle does.
He left it in his room by mistake. I brought
it along, and I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said after a while, &ldquo;it
pays to know a little about a great many
things. If you get sort of&mdash;well sort of shut
off from the world with someone else, you&rsquo;ve
always got something to talk about. Take liquid
air for instance. There&rsquo;s a grand little
topic for conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh? Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; Doug grunted.
He was already lost to the world in his contemplation
of that day&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>He need have had no fear for that ball game.
Never had Irons O performed so well as on
this day. Not only did he pitch a big league
type of game, allowing only seven hits and
no runs, but he kept the crowd in an uproar
of laughter with his bobbing head, his ludicrous
grimaces, and his wild-cat screams at
the umpire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect day!&rdquo; was Goggles&rsquo; enthusiastic
comment when it was over. &ldquo;And the little
dark man kept his word. He was not about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not, however, seen the last of the
little dark man&mdash;not quite. As, hopeful of receiving
a letter from his mother, he hurried
into the post-office, he ran squarely into him.
&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring his thoughts, the little dark man
waved a telegram in his face. &ldquo;From the Big
Shot!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You know, him that&rsquo;s
paid me. He says for me to quit! He says
that! Can you beat it?&rdquo; At that, he darted
from the door and was lost to the boy&rsquo;s sight
forever&mdash;or at least for a very, very long time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Big Bill&rsquo;s called him off,&rdquo; Goggles thought.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure good news. But I wonder why?&rdquo;
He was to wonder this many times in the days
that were to come and then, in the end, was
to know the answer.</p>
<p>Who can describe the joy of those days?
Seeing the world from an airplane&mdash;Salt Lake
City, Spokane with her magnificent falls, the
green timbered Cascade Mountains, and then
Seattle and the Pacific&mdash;all this came to them.
To play ball with the finest sort of fellows
from ranches, saw mills, canning factories, all
entertained and amused by the perfectly behaved
Irons O&mdash;all this was joy indeed. But
to know that this joyous excursion was fast
driving away clouds of doubt and fear, to know
that the big payment on the home ball grounds
was fast being collected&mdash;this indeed brought
deep, satisfying and lasting joy to the weary
boys.</p>
<p class="tb">One day, after a long drive with his grandfather,
Johnny Thompson wandered down to
the deserted baseball field to sit in the bleachers
in the sun. Meggy spied him from afar,
and came tripping down to take a place beside
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be back soon,&rdquo; Meggy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed dreamily. &ldquo;Their trip
has been a success. The ball ground is safe.
What&rsquo;s better still, old Professor George told
me this morning that Big Bill Tyson had
turned over a new leaf. He&rsquo;s going to give us
a deed for the land as soon as the four thousand
dollars is paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny! That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Meggy cried.
&ldquo;But Johnny! What made him change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Johnny replied. &ldquo;Guess each
man in the world has just so much capacity
for meanness, same as a barrel will hold only
so much water. Bill must have reached his
limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; Meggy suddenly changed the
subject. &ldquo;Did they ever find that little Chinaman
and the thought-camera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tao Sing?&rdquo; Johnny said soberly. &ldquo;No, not
yet I guess. But then,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t
very well prove he took that camera and the
think-o-graphs. What I figure is that someone
heard us talking there in the heart of the pines
that day, then came and got &rsquo;em that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time after that, there was silence. It
was Meggy who spoke at last:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The boys will have to be back soon. The
last big game is next Saturday&mdash;the final battle
for the pennant. Johnny, do you think the
&lsquo;Prince&rsquo; will pitch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your thought is as good as mine,&rdquo; Johnny
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he mysterious!&rdquo; Meggy thrilled as of
old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the half of it, Meg.&rdquo; Johnny
chuckled. &ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; he exploded in
a sudden burst of confidence, &ldquo;That fellow
isn&rsquo;t brown! He never came from India. He&rsquo;s
as white as you or I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whi&mdash;white? How could he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His face and arms are dyed. I saw him pull
up his sock, back there in the laboratories. You
just wait and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery&mdash;sweet mystery,&rdquo; Meggy whispered
after a time.</p>
<p>A moment more, and she was off on another
tack. &ldquo;Johnny, do you think those two terrible
men will come back to bother the&mdash;the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo;
if he does pitch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they do&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny stood up. &ldquo;If they
dare, we&mdash;we&rsquo;ll give them plenty! We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Meggy sprang to her feet. &ldquo;An
airplane! And see! Over there. A big silver
ship! The boys are coming home!&rdquo; She
dragged at Johnny&rsquo;s arm. They were away
like a flash, ready to celebrate the heroes&rsquo; return.</p>

<br />THE SMOKE SCREEN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I have a feeling&mdash;sort of dread&mdash;&rdquo; Doug
Danby&rsquo;s voice dropped. &ldquo;I believe they&rsquo;ll
try that trick of theirs again today&mdash;those
two fellows who go after the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo;&mdash;in a different
plane. If they do, then&mdash;&rdquo; he did not
finish. His voice trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I too have a feeling&mdash;&rdquo; there was a
suggestion of hidden knowledge in Johnny
Thompson&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I have a feeling that if
those two ill-wishers, who&rsquo;ve been trying to
break up our game every time the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; is
on the mound, try any tricks today, they&rsquo;ll get
fooled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cocked his head on one side as he murmured,
&ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s in the west, what wind there
is. Not much of any. Cloudy and damp. Just
right, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just right for what?&rdquo; Doug was curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. Just wait.&rdquo; Johnny lapsed
into silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Doug waited, and as he waited he thought.
They were long, long thoughts, I assure you.
The opening hour for the last game of the
season was approaching. Today the championship
of the series was to be decided. The
crowd exceeded that of any preceding game.
Excitement ran high.</p>
<p>Meggy Strawn, garbed in her brightest and
best, was already on the sidelines, ready to
lead in the cheering. Little wonder that chills
and thrills coursed through her. Was this not
the greatest day old Hillcrest had ever known?
Had not the four thousand dollars been paid
in full? Was not the ball park their very own&mdash;theirs
to have and to hold for many a year?
Yea! Yea! And yet there was mystery in the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something will happen today.&rdquo; One might
hear this whisper in many a corner. &ldquo;Something
strange, perhaps something quite terrible
will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it?&rdquo; Meg wondered.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on foot, by train, by auto,
the crowd continued to pour in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All paid attendance.&rdquo; Old Professor George
rubbed his hands together. &ldquo;You boys are
doing wonders! Hurray for old Hillcrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Doug was truly happy. &ldquo;But we
must win today, Professor. We truly must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would they? Centralia, the opposing
team, their ancient rival, was first up to bat.
As the mysterious &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; strolled out upon
the diamond a strange hush fell over the assembled
throng.</p>
<p>There were those in that crowd who had
said quite boldly that this mystery should not
be allowed to continue, that the pitcher should
reveal his true identity or stay out of the
game. &ldquo;Only evil people wish to hide their
identity,&rdquo; this was their argument.</p>
<p>So, with the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; in the box, the game
began. For three innings he pitched a faultless
game. Only two men found their way to
first base. They &ldquo;died&rdquo; there, Hillcrest scored
twice. Hopes ran high. Even Johnny Thompson,
sitting on the bench and expecting almost
anything, began to smile.</p>
<p>And then, out of the west came a gray
streak.</p>
<p>Just as he expected, as on that other day the
airplane began to circle. Down it came, lower
and lower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; did not glance up. &ldquo;But he
knows,&rdquo; Johnny whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s beginning
to break from the strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely this must be true. &ldquo;Men on first and
second; only one out!&rdquo; Johnny groaned.
&ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;ll make it. Sure to. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? A fire? To the west,
hardly three blocks away, a dense column of
smoke appeared. Rising higher and higher
in the all but quiet sky, it at last drifted slowly
over the ball grounds. So dense was it that
it cast a deep shadow over all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; Johnny sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Hurray!
That beats &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, considering the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; had just
walked a man, filling the bases, seemed sheer
madness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m out of my head,&rdquo; was
Johnny&rsquo;s second thought as he sank back into
his place.</p>
<p>That Johnny was right was soon enough
demonstrated. Seeming to find fresh power
flowing through his veins, the mysterious
pitcher stiffened his pace. The two men who
came up next got three pitches each. They
fanned the air. The inning was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We arranged to put up a smoke screen,&rdquo;
Johnny whispered to Meggy. &ldquo;Set a lot of
old tar paper on fire. That checkmated those
fellows in the airplane. They couldn&rsquo;t see
through it, nor&mdash;nor do anything else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Johnny! Who&rsquo;s in that plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know tonight, per&mdash;perhaps,&rdquo; was
Johnny&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>Three times the airplane circled. Three
times a pillar of smoke rose to meet it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That airplane is from River Forest,&rdquo; Big
Bill Tyson said to Colonel Chamberlain. &ldquo;Hate
to take you away from the game; but if we&rsquo;re
to be there when they land, we&rsquo;d better be
travelin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later a long gray car shot
away to the east. In it rode Big Bill and Colonel
Chamberlain. Big Bill was at last truly
interested in the boys of his city.</p>
<p>Johnny saw them leave the field. He knew
why they were going, and smiled.</p>
<p>The boy who received the greatest surprise,
however, was Fred Frame, the one-time star
pitcher. As the team came in for its turn at
bat, Doug Danby sidled over to him at the end
of the sixth inning and said in a low tone:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are to pitch next inning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! What?&rdquo; Fred&rsquo;s brain whirled. Was
he to finish this last game? Score 2 to 0 in
Hillcrest&rsquo;s favor! The championship at stake!
He to pitch! He could not understand.</p>
<p>Nor was he to know more save that the
&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; a trifle more stooped than usual, but
walking with a firm, proud tread, was leaving
the grounds.</p>
<p>Slowly a buzz like the swarming of bees
sounded through the crowd. Then all was
still.</p>
<p>It was well that Fred did not come up to
bat that inning. He surely would have fanned.</p>
<p>As at last he stood in the pitcher&rsquo;s box, he
found above him a cloudless, smokeless sky
where no airplane soared and circled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think I&rsquo;m small fry!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Not
worth bothering with! I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seventh and eighth innings passed without
a score on either side.</p>
<p>In the ninth, two Centralia men fanned. The
game seemed over. Then came a two-bagger,
followed by a single that brought in a run.
By taking wild chances, the runner on first
base stole second, then third. So there it was,
last inning, two men down and the tying run
on third.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Wildly Fred&rsquo;s eyes searched the crowd for
the familiar figure of the &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; a voice seemed to whisper.
&ldquo;You may never see him again. Perhaps he
is no real person at all&mdash;just a sort of imaginary
being. It&rsquo;s up to you, and you alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the catcher gave him a signal. For
such a time as this, it seemed a piece of madness,
that signal. But Fred was desperate. He
took the chance.</p>
<p>Winding up, he sent the ball spinning. It
was a wild throw&mdash;a perfect wild throw, if
wild throws you want. By one mad leap the
catcher was able to knock it down. Even so,
he did not stop it. It went on rolling. He was
after it in a mad scramble.</p>
<p>Shooting down the course came the tying
run.</p>
<p>But not so fast! Francisco the catcher had
the ball. He was on the home plate. The runner
turned to dash back. He all but fell into
Fred&rsquo;s arms. And Fred had the ball. Francisco
had passed it back to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>This mad play, so cleverly planned and executed,
had won! The game was over. Hillcrest
was champion!</p>
<p>The crowd went wild. Seizing Fred, they
tossed him to their shoulders, shouting: &ldquo;Hurray
for Fred! Hurray for Fred!&rdquo; He tried to
shout, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Prince&rsquo;!&rdquo; but his cries were
drowned by a roar.</p>
<p>It was an interesting group that gathered
in Colonel Chamberlain&rsquo;s office two hours later.
There was Johnny and Goggles, Fred
Frame and Meggy. Besides these there was
Big Bill Tyson and close beside him, grim
and sullen, sat the two strangers who had
caused so much trouble. There was too a tall,
slightly stooped young man. At first the boys
stared at him in wondering silence. &ldquo;Who is
he? Who can he be?&rdquo; they whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you do not recognize a friend,&rdquo; Colonel
Chamberlain smiled. &ldquo;I am surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&mdash;&rdquo; he paused to smile once more.
&ldquo;This is your old friend J., the one you have
called the &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo; Today, for the first time,
he is able to remove the dye that might have
concealed his identity from some people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; came as in one breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; the Colonel said, turning to J.,
&ldquo;perhaps you will tell them your story. Only,&rdquo;
he warned, &ldquo;be brief. There&rsquo;s a big feast of
real good things to eat in store for us after it
is told. Tonight the business men of Hillcrest
are giving a banquet to all the boys who have
fought so bravely for the honor of their city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us! Tell us!&rdquo; they all pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated
with chemistry. My native home is in
Europe. Three years ago I was allowed to enter
another country as a student. At once I
was successful with my chemistry. Men said
I had made some remarkable discoveries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;success brings enemies.
There are those who wished to possess my
secrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The part of that strange country I was in,&rdquo;
he went on after a period of silence, &ldquo;was disputed
territory. In time it became known that
it was to be controlled entirely by this nation
that was not friendly to my native land. This
meant that I must leave. Many men came to
me demanding to know my scientific secrets,
which&mdash;pardon my pride&mdash;were very valuable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I refused. They threatened to have me sent
to prison. I defied them and finally, with my
secret formula hidden away in my garments,
I escaped to America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they followed, still threatening me. I
put on that disguise, which has deceived some.
Unfortunately it did not deceive all. So tonight
I am removing it. Tonight I have taken
out my first papers as an American citizen.
Soon I shall belong to your wonderful country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Good! Fine! Wonderful!&rdquo; came
from the throats of his hearers.</p>
<p>Only two were silent&mdash;the two strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you!&rdquo; The &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; made a dramatic
gesture. &ldquo;Why do you still persecute me?&rdquo;
He had turned upon the silent pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the Colonel when the men
did not reply, &ldquo;it is because of greed and a deplorable
race hatred. You need not, however,
fear them any longer. They have done enough
to send them to prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; exclaimed, &ldquo;I do not
wish! Only that they shall pledge themselves
never to disturb me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;you shall
be the judge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>He turned upon the strangers. &ldquo;Do you
promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes sir. We do!&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. You may go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any other questions?&rdquo; The Colonel turned
to his young guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to know what happened that
day when the&mdash;the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; was obliged to
leave the pitcher&rsquo;s box,&rdquo; said Meggy, &ldquo;that
first day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny sprang up, &ldquo;let me try to
explain that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out a long tube with a very bright
inside, also a small battery and two small bottles
of powder. &ldquo;You put the two powders in
the tube, then touch them off with the battery.
This makes a blinding flash that may be directed
like the shot of a gun at any single individual.
That&rsquo;s what they did to the &lsquo;Prince&rsquo;
from the airplane,&rdquo; he explained rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he went on in a
puzzled tone, &ldquo;is why it should spoil your
game.&rdquo; He turned toward the &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will explain,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo; &ldquo;I once
was in a terrible chemical explosion. My sight
was saved only as a sort of miracle. Since then,
a flash of light half blinds me for hours. These
men, knowing this, invented that instrument
of torture. So now,&rdquo; he added, smiling, &ldquo;you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you leave the game today?&rdquo;
Meggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that!&rdquo; The &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; smiled a rare
smile. &ldquo;That was a case of <i>noblesse oblige</i>. The
team was yours. The game yours too. How
could I, a stranger, truly win it when that
plucky boy of yours had tried so nobly? It
was a duty of honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s eyes were dimmed.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call sporting!</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more question!&rdquo; Johnny was on his
feet. &ldquo;This may seem strange, but &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo;
were you ever in prison in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; smiled a strange smile.
&ldquo;I have not had the honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one of my bum guesses,&rdquo; Johnny
thought to himself. He was thinking of the
story told to him by that air pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Colonel, springing to
his feet, &ldquo;I call you all to a banquet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>The banquet was all that anyone could ask,
but, as for Johnny Thompson, his mind was
on other things. As he was hurrying to this
meeting, Chief Gallagher had called to him:
&ldquo;Come in and see me as soon as you can. I&rsquo;ve
got something big to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to do with the little Chinaman Tao
Sing and the thought-camera,&rdquo; Johnny assured
himself more than once. As soon as he
could, he was away to the Chief&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right the very first time, Johnny,&rdquo;
the Chief laughed when Johnny hazarded a
guess. &ldquo;We caught up with that little Chink
this afternoon. He and two others were tryin&rsquo;
to make a getaway in an airplane. Guess they
didn&rsquo;t savvy that plane. Anyway, that plane
didn&rsquo;t get far. Those Chinamen had parachutes.
They landed safely. Our men picked
them up. Plane came down in flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer part&mdash;&rdquo; he rumbled, &ldquo;that little fellow
wanted to jump right into the flaming
wreck. Said he wanted to save something&mdash;only
one in the world. Man that made it was
dead&mdash;all that stuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;my
men wouldn&rsquo;t let him commit suicide that way.
He&rsquo;ll go back to China with those other fellows.
The tong war is over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That thing he wanted to save,&rdquo; said Johnny
soberly, &ldquo;must have been the thought-camera.
And I&mdash;you know I&rsquo;m sort of glad it&rsquo;s
gone and that there are no more in the world.
For you know&mdash;it&rsquo;s no fun at all to take pictures
of other people&rsquo;s thoughts. And to have
other people taking pictures of yours&mdash;why
that would be simply terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Captain said with a laugh. &ldquo;It
sure would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny enjoyed a few peaceful days in Hillcrest.
After that he was off for fresh adventure.
